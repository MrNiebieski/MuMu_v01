So once you, the shopper discovers they
have a need that can be satisfied
by making a purchase, they enter the
next stage, which is the information
search stage.
In this stage, they search for information
about different
products, and they end up with what we
call a consideration
set, the set of items that they consider
purchasing.
The consideration set is usually a limited
set.
It's sometimes only as many as three or
four items
that a consumer will really consider
making a purchase from.
and this consideration set is different
than an evoked set.
If you think about the overall set of
products,
let's take a soft drink category in a
traditional
supermarket, there may be, in the total,
in the
total set, in the total product class,
maybe 50 different
brands of soft drink.
But if I ask you, how many of those
different brands could
you name, you might only be able to name
20, or 30, perhaps.
That's your evoke set, the number of
brands that you can remember without any
help.
From that evoke set, you may only consider
a few brands in your consideration set.
So you start from the total category, 50
brands, go down
to an evoke set, 30 brands, and you're
finally down
to a consideration set that's maybe only
three or four brands.
From that consideration set, you may only
choose to purchase one or two brands.
So the brands get winnowed down very
quickly.
And this is a stage that many, many brands
get knocked out of consideration.
It's very important for the consumer to
ultimately consider your brand.
How does a brand end up in the
consideration set?
Well, all brands that exist in the product
class are in the total set.
But then to get winnowed down the
to consideration set, there's usually two
different processes.
One is branding, advertising, out of store
kinds of brand building that creates brand
awareness, and that brand gets lodged in
the consumer and the shopper's mind.
And the brand then, the consumer then,
when they're
choosing or thinking about a brand to
consider, will remember
certain brands they've heard of and will
consider those brands
that they know about through advertising
or through other mechanisms.
Another way a brand gets considered is in
the store.
So when you go in the store, you may see
the
brands that are on the shelf and you'll
consider those brands.
In the brands that you
get that come in from advertising, those
brands
are what I called your evoked set, I
tell you the name of a number of
different brands, and you can remember
certain brands.
That's because, previously, you've seen
some advertising.
That's your evoked set.
There are also some brands that you don't
really remember right
now, but you have seen before, the ones
you don't recall.
And then I can do some kind of trigger or
some kind of aided recall to remember, or
to get you
to remember those brands.
The brands you see in the store take two
different shapes.
One is you actively search the shelf and
you look for different brands,
and you may consider different brands that
you see through your active search.
Another way brands can get into your
consideration set is accidentally.
Maybe there's something that the store put
at the end of the aisle that you
didn't consider, and you ran into it and
suddenly that brand is in your
consideration set.
But this is a very, very important stage
for brands to remain.
When consumers, if you're not in the
consumer's
consideration set, then the consumer will
never consider you.
By the way, again in this omni-channel
world, there's
new opportunities to get brands considered
in the set.
Not only in stores, in physical stores
will consumers see
what's on the shelf, but more and more
there are kiosks.
There's terminals and
tablets in the store where you can search
online for something.
And so brands can get in the consideration
set between that, that online and
offline experience with in store personal
recommendations
or displays, or a salesperson could
suggest something.
Similarly if you're shopping online
through different
kinds of search processes or, or display
ads or something that's done online you
can get your brand in the consideration
set.
So traditional advertising creates brand
awareness.
All the big ads that we see create brand
familiarity, the
big brands that you know that are in your
consideration set.
For example Nike might be in your
consideration set for sport
shoes, or Coke may be in your
consideration set for soft drinks.
These are big, big brands where
advertising created that heavy duty brand
awareness.
The other way though to create brand
awareness is in a store.
And sometimes we see some of these brands
create awareness for their brand by
doing flagship stores, so there's a big
beautiful Apple store in New York City.
there's a big Ralph Lauren mansion in New
York City.
And part of the goal is not only to sell
you products, but to create
brand awareness for those brands, so you
consider
those brands next time you make a
purchase.
There's also online flagship stores.
One of the most,
the, the best flagship stores that I've
seen recently online which, and what
I mean by that is a web, a website store,
is the Burberry site.
Maybe you can go to the Burberry site
after this session and take
a look at what they do to create brand
awareness for their brand, Burberry.
And so that when you're in the market
for an overcoat, you might consider the
brand Burberry.
So another way that consumers or
shoppers can identify brands to be in
their
consideration set is in the store through
external search.
And at that point, what the marketer
really needs to
be, pay attention to, is to actually what
drives consumer attention.
What will consumers notice?
and some of the things that make a
difference for what consumers
notice is how they come into the store,
what is their goal.
So if they come into
the store with a taxonomic goal like let's
buy some ketchup, they tend to go right
to the category, and then they'll tend to
buy brands that they've already thought of
before.
But if they come into the store like a
store like this with the
goal, let's get something for dinner,
they're
very much influenced by what's in the
store.
They also can be very influenced by social
influences, maybe right before they came
into the store,
well somebody on Facebook had a status
that said, I just
had a terrific experience in my purchase
of such and such product.
That could make a difference.
Consumer reviews can make a difference,
and in-store salespeople make a big
difference as to what brands might be put
into a shopper's consideration set.
But another way to get customers'
attention is what you put on the shelf.
And in this way, you might use different
packaging cues, you can use different
shelf cues, you can use
signs, you can use color to get customers'
attention, and it's very
important that when you use these
different cues that consumers not
only pay attention to what you're doing,
but that they get it.
So, for example, one very striking way to
get consumers' attention is to use color
blocking.
You can do it with packaged goods, and if
all the other products in your category
are black or
white or some neutral colors and you come
in with a bright
green or a bright purple, the consumers
are going to pay attention to it.
Here in the whole foods market, a lot of
attention gets paid to the produce.
They use color blocking here very
strikingly
to get consumers' attention, and once
consumers
pay attention to these different products,
they're
much more likely to consider purchasing
it.
Packaging themselves can
make a difference and can get consumer's
attention, but you have to
to be careful to make sure
that the consumers interpret the packaging
appropriately.
For example, there's a very famous story
about Tropicana brand, where they hired a
well-known designer to change the package
to
what tested in, in, in laboratory very
well.
It was a beautiful new design for the
Tropicana orange juice package.
The problem was, the consumer was very
familiar with the old package.
When they went into the store to recognize
the new, to,
to buy their old familiar packaged
Tropicana, they didn't recognize the
brand new design, the new package, and
they ended up purchasing
a different brand of orange juice rather
than the familiar one.
Here's an example where because the brand
did
not get the consumer's attention, the
brand fell out
of consideration, and the consumer shopper
bought something else.
Another way to use packaging is to get the
consumer
to consider different varieties within a
line or different price points.
You can use packaging on shelf, use color,
different colors within the
line to indicate higher priced items,
lower priced items, natural items,
different flavors.
So sometimes you'll see within a product
line, the higher
priced item is gold or silver, the regular
item
is blue, and the lower item is a different
color.
Or you may see colors being used to, to
show
different flavors or whether or not it's
gluten-free or natural.
And this is a way that you can get
consumers' attention and get
consumers to consider multiple items
within a set by packaging on the shelf.
