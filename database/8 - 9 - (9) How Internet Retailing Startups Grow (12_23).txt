So now, we're going to continue our
discussion of how the real
world and the virtual world interact with
each other in online/offline competition.
So if you look at the slide, there are
five companies that
I'm going to speak about and this is
actually very exciting for me.
Because these are comapnies I've had the
pleasure
of working with in terms of analyzing
their
data, and also doing some research trying
also
to help out the management team a little
bit.
First one is a company called
netgrocer.com.
It was really one of the very, very early
companies
in the internet selling non perishable
groceries starting at about May 1997.
And I'm going to show you how that
business grew
and evolved, and try and give you a sense
of how it is that Ebusiness companies,
Ecommerce companies
spread themselves over time and over space
in particular markets.
the second company I'm going to talk about
is one of
our favorites of course, it's part of the
Quidsi family.
That's diapers.com which began life in
2005
at 1-800-DIAPERS.com.
In fact you may see a little bit behind
me.
I'm actually still here in the Quidsi
warehouse,
again backgrounded by 1.1 Sorry, 1,200,000
square feet of
warehouse space, robots, and so on,
shipping diapers and
all kinds of stuff all over the United
States.
The third company we're going to talk
about, warbyparker.com
this company was founded a little bit
later.
This company was founded in 2010 in
February
by four students at the Wharton School
who wanted to do something very, very
interesting.
They wanted to take a product that most of
us are buying offline.
If you wear the product, which is glasses.
That's what Warby Parker sells.
You would go into an optician's, get your
eyes tested, and maybe
try on a bunch of different frames, and
buy glasses in that environment.
Now what the forefounders noticed is at
that point in time, less than 2%
of that product category in the United
States were sold online so they build
a company to try and change that and
sell glasses online and also through
offline channels.
So, we'll talk about those guys a little
bit, if
you happen to be in Boston or New York
City you
could even go and visit the flagship store
they have
their own real world flagship store
selling products directly to customers.
The fourth company I'm going to talk about
a little bit is a company called Bonobos.
This is a little bit later then
Diapers.com and a little bit earlier than
WarbyParker.com.
It was founded in 2007 by two
general coming out of the Stanford
Business School.
The current CEO is still there, Andy Dunn.
And their idea was to sell men, for all
the guys out there fashion items at great
prices and
also fashion items that really sort of fit
you
and give a better feel and trim than other
products.
The final and fifth company on the slide
is
citruslane founded by a friend of mine
Mariah out there
in California.
Really addressing the problem that some of
us
have if we have children, how to get the
best toys, the best stuff, the best kind
of gifts for our kids on an ongoing basis.
Basically to discover new products that
are
relevant to households that have small
children.
And if we don't have small children
ourselves,
we might like to gift that to somebody
else.
So those are the five companies that we're
going to sort of look a
little bit under the hood to try to
understand how all of this works.
So,
I'm just going to explain a little bit
about what
we do as academics when we examine these
things, and what
I've done with my friends and coauthors,
is we're able
to get the sales data from these companies
and match it
up with other data mainly provided by the
US government
about the kinds of people that live in
different areas of
the United States And then understand how
the characteristics of
a physical environment affect the sales of
a virtual world company.
So, why is it that one zip code has very,
very low sales
of Diapers.com products and another one
may have thousands and thousands of
customers?
Those were the things we were trying to
understand and
that was the data that we used to do it.
So the next thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to take us through five
principles that I
discovered with my coauthors doing this
research about
how the online world and the offline world
interact.
If you're interested in reading this,
the article's called, What Matters Most in
Internet Retailing.
It was published by the Sloan Management
Review.
So, the first thing that we found, kind of
summarizes some of the other things that
we talked about
earlier, is that when an online business
opens up, it
changes the cost benefit for the shopper
in particular locations.
So, if I'm living in Philadelphia 19123,
which is where I
do live, and I have access to certain
kinds of stores to
buy clothing, and let's imagine the
closest one is two or three miles away.
When an internet store opens up, let's
call it jeans.com
that changes the relative attractiveness
of shopping online versus offline.
So that's the first thing.
When an internet company comes into play
it changes
the relative cost and benefit of shopping
online versus offline.
So now we're back on principal two.
The second of our five principals.
So the second principal that I discovered
primarily
in the beginning looking at sales from
netgrocer.com starting
in 1997 is that the way ecommerce
companies develop
their sales is very structured and very
very predictable.
And so what I'm going to show you now is a
very
interesting graphic that starts out way
back in May, 1997, and there's
a picture of the US, you can see there on
the
screen, United States, and you can see the
areas that are shaded.
Those shaded areas are areas where
somebody in that location, in
that zip code, of which there are more
than 30,000 in
the United States, had actually placed an
order at the website
netgrocer.com, way, way back in the dark
ages of internet retailing.
Now what's interesting is we fast forward
through the
slides what we can see is that by the
time we've got about 42 months out or
about
three and a half years out, Netgrocer.com
was selling
products in more than 18,000 zip codes.
That's why the whole map now looks rather
dark and rather shaded throughout the
entire United States.
So an interesting question then arises.
How does this business grow?
How did it go from 34 zip codes in 1997 to
three and half years later in 2001,
selling into more than 18,000 zip codes.
What did that look like?
And if we were to sit there in January
2001 and say to ourselves, and February
2001,
where are the new customers going to come
from?
Are they just going to pop up randomly in
the
United States, or will there be some
special structure?
Now, if you're guessing that there's some
special structure, you'd be right.
And let me now show you the next series of
slides that illustrates that.
Now, what I've done in these slides is
I've separated
the East Coast and the West Coast of the
United States.
So, primarily around California and
primarily around the New
York City area, and what you can see as
the slide rolls through, is that sales
tend to
pop up in areas around that had existing
sales previously.
So, you tend to get more new customers
showing up
in locations that are close to locations
that had customers before.
Now, why is that?
Well, there's really two reasons.
The first reason is, perhaps I buy
something and
I live in zip code 19123 and when I'm at
my
local cafe or when I'm in my apartment
building, I tell
one of my neighbors, hey, you really
should try soap.com, and
so there's a conversation or a word of
mouth that takes place.
The second thing that goes on that's also
very very interesting
is it could be the case that customers are
observing the
behaviors of other customers you might
have asked yourself the question
why is it that Ecommerce companies have
really really ugly packaging sometimes.
Why does our friend Chris at soap.com ship
us
stuff in a box that's green, and brown,
and
orange, and all kinds of colors, that if
you
wearing them, you would look rather, let's
say, clownish.
Well, the reason that's done is because
the box
really kind of pops and it really stands
out.
So when my order from soap.com comes to
the office at the Wharton store.
And it sits there in the office.
Anyone coming into the suite is going to
see
it, and so that's why you see that very,
very structured pattern.
There's observation, and there's also word
of mouth.
So keep those two things in mind, because
when we get to our
next module, and we're going to talk about
how to grow the customer base
and how to find those two, those lead
users, thinking about leveraging word
of mouth and leveraging social observation
is going to be very, very important.
Now let's move on to principal number
three.
So principal number three is sort of a
further
look under the hood of principal number
two.
So you might of wondered, and you can go
to the website, doppelganger.com, who your
celebrity doppelganger is.
That's whose your celebrity look,
look-alike.
if you were to walk down the street, would
people ping you as George Clooney, Brad
Pitt, Jessica Biel?
Who knows?
So also you might imagine for locations,
there's the same kind of concept.
So perhaps Pennnsylvania
19104 is almost the same as another zip
code in some other
place in Texas, and so we wanted to
examine this idea of
whether or not similar locations that were
far away from each other
would also start to buy things online at
roughly the same time.
So the original idea for this actually
comes from a very,
very interesting study conducted way back
in the 1970s by a sociologist.
And what he did is he
kind of changed our idea of distance from
just
purely physical distance to also thinking
about social distance.
What do I mean by social distance?
So in the original study, Professor Fisher
showed that if you lived
in Chicago, there was a higher chance that
you would meet or randomly
interact with somebody from Los Angeles,
which is very, very far from Chicago,
than there would be that you
would interact with somebody from
Springfield, Illinois,
which is much closer.
So even though Chicago and Springfield are
close
together, in many other ways they're quite
different.
The kinds of people that live there, the
way
they think, the stuff they like is very
different.
Even though Chicago and Los Angeles are
very very far apart in terms of distance.
There could be a lot more similarity in
terms of the tastes that people live
there.
They both like big cities.
They both like to consume certain kinds of
goods and services.
So, continuing with our discussion of
principal number three.
What we found was very, very interesting.
When we looked at the sales of
internet retailer, initially, those sales
started to
take off in larger cities and spread, like
the pattern that I showed you earlier,
spread through the notion of proximity,
meaning
people living close together were either
telling
each other about the good or service,
or perhaps copying each other from seeing
discarded
boxes and so on.
So in the beginning of the sales process,
those sales
started to spread out by proximity, from
one customer to another.
But what happened over time was very, very
interesting.
Sales in those key locations started to
for,
for want of a better term, tap out, and
reach a city state, and then pick up in
other locations that were further apart
from each other.
But yet shared very important
characteristics.
So you might have two
locations, in different parts of the
United
States maybe even a thousand miles apart.
But the basic profile in terms of the
age, income, occupation, education level
and so on.
And also of the retail environment would
be very similar.
Those are those doppelganger locations
that I talked about.
And because those locations are very
similar in terms of who
lives there and the opportunities for
shopping offline, they tend to migrate
online at roughly the same rate.
What we did when we discovered this, in
the
beginning through proximity, over time
more through similarity of locations.
That we were able to develop something we
call the long tail plot, again,
borrowing from our friend Chris Anderson,
but
this time, a long tail plot over location.
So if you look at the slide, what you'll
see is
you'll see, on the X axis different
locations in the United States,
and the Y axis is the level of sales.
So, the sales start very, very high in the
best location and then they taper down to
the lower
locations, but those lower locations that
generate small sales levels
individually are still very, very
important for an Ecommerce company.
That's the key takeaway.
You can't just survive by hitting the big
markets.
You have to also hurt the many smaller
markets that collectively add
up to a lot.
It's the same idea as Chris Anderson's
long
tail, but this time, if you think back
to that previous discussion, this time the
x-axis
is about location, as opposed to being
about products.
