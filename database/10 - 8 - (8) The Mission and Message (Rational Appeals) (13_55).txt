So, let's continue on with the mission.
What is it that we're trying to influence?
And again as Barbara and Pete and I have
gone through the sessions together.
With you guys, you probably heard each of
us say at
various points in time and certainly this
was something I mentioned earlier.
The objectives around marketing
communication
really fall into three broad buckets.
Thinking, are you trying to change
somebody's beliefs, the way they think?
So earlier we gave an example of the pork
marketing board convincing
people that pork was in the white meat
camp,
the good meat, the fish and chicken, and
not the
bad meat camp, which is red meat, of beef
and lamb, which may not be as good for
you.
So, pork, the other white meat, that's a
thinking campaign.
Secondly, your objective might be to
change the way people feel.
This is behind the Google ad's called dear
Sophie
I encourage you if you haven't seen those
type dear
Sophie into Google and watch the ad its
really a
great ad that shows how Google is trying
to build
emotion into their brand.
And finally action you might be trying to
get
people to do stuff, that's what I showed
you that
milk campaign the whole goal of that
campaign was
to get people to put more milk in the
refrigerator.
So whatever model you think about whatever
model
you use it's really designed around those
three goals.
I've put a couple of other things on the
slide to help you remember this.
So, there's a model called the ADIA model
that means action,
decision, interest, awareness some of them
are longer chains
going all the way from awareness to
purchase and repurchase.
Some other companies now notably McKinsey
sometimes thinks about the
purchase cycle as a circle as opposed to a
funnel.
But whatever you're doing at its core is
really about
thinking feeling action and that's why on
the right hand
side of the screen in terms of measurement
here's the
things we would measure that would tell us
if we were
meeting those objectives.
So, if we have a thinking objective.
What's the mind share that we're getting
for the customer?
Does the customer remember us, know us,
heard our name, can they recall it?
The second one is the share of heart, how
much positive emotion do they have for us?
What good words do they say when they see
our, our brand name for example?
And then finally for action, what's the
share of market?
That we're generating, and what's our
ability beyond
just market shares generate incremental
consumption in the product categories.
So those are the metrics that we're
thinking about.
Okay, so let's continue now looking into
the mission in more detail.
And I'm going to give it in terms of two
broad categories of appeal to people.
You can appeal to people's brains, to
their rational side.
You can appeal to people's hearts, to
their emotional side.
And I'd like you just to think for a
moment before we
go into the different methodologies under
what conditions do you
think it would be more effective to have
a, a
rational appeal, and under what conditions
do you think it
might be more effective to have more an
emotional appeal?
So, just think about that as we go through
the examples let me start with the
rational appeals.
So the first one you might want to do
would be sort of a demonstration of the
product.
So in this case we have a shaving company
called Norelco showing
a gentleman shaving his face and then at
the bottom a fairly detailed
diagram of the hairs being pulled out of
the face and being trimmed.
So when is demonstration, a good rational
appeal, appropriate?
Typically it's appropriate where you have
a product that has certain key
features that you really want the customer
to try and understand the benefit.
That's when the rational appeal of
demonstration
is partic, a particularly or especially
effective.
Secondly, another kind of rational appeal
is sometimes
to use a spokesperson to sort of, say
well, if this
person uses the product then maybe I
should use it as well.
Here you're trying to transfer some
positive benefit from the
characteristic of the person onto the
characteristics of the product.
So here's Danica Patrick the famous a
racer
who now is advertising Go Daddy so Go
Daddy's
suppose to be fast its suppose to be
fun its suppose to be interesting to deal
with.
To transfer all
of those benefits or aspects of the Danica
Patra's sorry Danica Patrick's personality
onto that particular product.
Okay, another example of that here you see
Martina Hingis
she's promoting a certain product it turns
out to be
a watch while she's also Swiss this is a
Swiss
watch so theres kind of a connection
between the two.
The third one I'm showing here is also the
same
watch company this time instead of using a
Swiss person
their using an American person, the famous
swimmer
Michael Phelps, who I believe I think
wasn't
he the one that got eight gold metals
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics so pretty
prolific athlete.
However, unfortunately and this is now
showing a little
bit of the dark side Michael Phelps also
likes
to do other things in his spare time and
here he was captured by News of the World.
So, the upside of using a spokes
person is their positive characteristics,
get transferred
onto the product in a way that makes sense
for
the customer, but sometimes you can't
really control what they do.
So, that might lead you to use this kind
of person as your spokesperson
and in this case what your doing is you're
using Charlie Brown or Snoopy
character to try and soften the idea that
a bank or a financial services
company is sort of cold and only caring
about money and boring and bureaucratic.
That's the kind of,
those are the kind of things unfortunately
that people
often say about financial service
companies, but you can
soften that image, make them think a
little bit
different who you are by using a cartoon
character.
Now, I should point out this campaign was
more effective in
the United States than it was in other
places, I believe,
in the UK, where it was seen as a little
frivolous
to have a cartoon character managing part
of my financial life.
The Brits
are a little bit more serious, so again as
we're finishing our discussion
of spokespeople maybe you can think of
your own favorite spokesperson whether its
a
fictitious character like Charlie Brown or
a real person like Michael Phelps or
Danica Patrick that maybe has changed the
way you thought about a particular brand.
I'm sure that you could come up with your
own examples.
So now let's continue on let's look at the
next kind of rational appeal which is a
testimonial.
Now, when are testimonials
particular important or particular
effective they're
effective when the person that's buying
the product or service may end up using
this product or service over
a long period of time and/or has no real
way to understand before
purchase whether this is going to be a
good product or not for them.
So in that case, it's really nice to have
some other user tell you, hey, I've stayed
at the Hilton, and it's fantastic, hey,
I've
used the LaserJet and I haven't had to
repair
it for years.
So somebody else who's been through the
consumption
experience is telling you how good it is.
And you're hoping to take the message that
you'll have the same experience.
So when the consumption experience is
uncertain testimonials are particularly
effective at changing the way that you're
going to think.
The next one is a little bit more of a
perhaps US biased one.
We don't see too much of this in my home
country in New Zealand.
And those of you out there in other parts
of the world may find that in your
country, directly comparative advertising
is either number one,
not legal, or number two, it's just
something
that people are not very comfortable with
culturally.
However, in the United States, you see a
lot
of advertising that's directly
comparative, so let me take
you through a couple of examples showing
how it
can be used and also showing some of the
pitfalls.
So, what we have on the screen here in
front
of us now is an advertisement that was put
together
by the United States Postal Service and
what's
the United States Postal Service trying to
do?
Well, they're trying to frame the
conversation
about services for sending packages,
envelopes across the
country in the United States, they're
trying to frame it in terms of the price.
So they've shown two maps of the United
States and on the left hand side there's
Fedex charging you anywhere from $6, 7,
$8,
$10 to ship across the United States UPS
also charging a similar range of prices
whereas for the good old post
office you can send things anywhere for a
mere $3 so they're really
trying to highlight the fact that they
have in vibrous language, a point
of difference or an advantage over their
competitors on the basis of price.
Now, of course if you were one of the
managers at either Fedex or UPS
and you wanted to hit back at this
comparison how would you go about doing
that?
Well you might take another attribute
where you
believe you have an advantage over the
post office.
That attribute might be on time delivery
percentage
it might be speed of arrival of something
of
that sort and what you might do is you
might redraw the map and show gee we
get 99.99% of our packages there within a
day and then show a map of the United
States with the post office either not
delivering or
taking a very long point of, very long
amount
of time.
So that's one way that you could respond
to comparative advertising.
Now of course there's always a little bit
of danger that you haven't fully
anticipated how savvy your competitor
actually is
and what your competitor is going to do.
So Barbara talked a lot about competiton
and
thinking about points of difference and
points of parity.
So here's an advertisement that was run by
Audi in Santa Monica in
the United States, you can see the nice a
scenery of Santa Monica
there in the background.
And so Audi put up a big billboard that
says your move BMW as if to say hey we're
here now what are you going to do BMW
comes
back with the billboard on the right that
says checkmate.
So a very clever advertisement.
So you have to be a little bit careful
when you go down
this comparative game, that the other guy
might sort of out think you.
I'll give one final example of this
that I find particularly funny and
particularly interesting.
You can look this one
up on the Internet.
A couple of years ago in the
United States, there was something called
the Soup
Wars, the Soup Wars, S, O, it sounds
crazy, S-O-U-P, soup that you might eat.
So here in Philadelphia we're quite close
to the
Campbell's soup company its just over the
bridge in
New Jersey and the Campbell's soup company
is the
number one company selling soup here in
the United States.
And I forget the exact details but here's
how the story goes they had a brand of
soup that they believed one of their many
many different lines that they have.
There was more helpful better tasting and
so on better for you then
their competitor across the street who I
think at the time was Progresso.
So they did the big advertisement that hey
our soup
is so healthy and those Progresso guys
that putting a
bit of MSG you know that mono sodium
glutem glutimate
its hard to say isn't it in their in their
soup.
So you
might think, gee, that's a good thing to
do, because this soup is healthier than
the competitor.
Now unfortunately, while Campbell's did
have
an extremely healthy soup, that was only
one of, hundreds of other varieties of
soup that they were also selling.
So how did the competitor hit back?
The competitor hit back, with full
page advertisements in major media
outlets, showing
the iconic Andy Warhol Campbell's soup
can,
you might know what I'm talking about.
You might have seen those iconic cans
that Andy Warhol the artist in New
York used to paint of Campbell's soup,
basically
saying, yeah, okay, so those guys do have
one or two healthy kinds of soup.
But most of what they sell is full of MSG.
Now, of course, Campbell's hadn't
anticipated that.
But you know what?
That ended up not like just like the BMW
and Audi example, that ended up being bad
for everybody.
My poor old friend over there, Chris,
who's
been eating soup for breakfast, lunch, and
dinner,
suddenly says, oh, my goodness!
Soup is full of MSG.
So, in that case comparative advertising
depressed the entire market for soup.
Isn't that fascinating so be a little bit
careful if your going to go down that
comparative game.
Now, let me talk about the final thing in
terms of
rational appeal because often rational
appeals are making claims to try to
convince you that A is better than B, so I
think
it bears keeping in mind that sometimes or
most times those claims
are based on different kinds of surveys
and different kinds of data.
And like any survey things can always be
twisted
to give the story that you particularly
want to tell.
So let me show you an example of two
hamburger chains here
in the United States and actually around
the world, so Burger King.
And I believe the other one was
McDonald's.
So let's look at the Burger King survey.
So Burger King does a survey and they ask
people how would you prefer to have your
hamburger.
Would you rather have it fried?
Or flame broiled.
Now when it's said in those terms, frame
broiled just sounds a lot better than
fried.
I don't really want to have a fried
burger.
In fact, 75% of the people prefer the
flame boil, broiled burger.
And that of course is the method of
cooking that's used by Burger King.
So then perhaps what they could do is
they could go out in an advertising
campaign and
say, 75% of the people who eat burgers
prefer the way we cook them at Burger
King.
And,
on the basis of that survey, it would be
true.
Now of course, if you ran another survey,
and
I think this is something similar to what
McDonald's or
one of the other competitors did, you
could change the
framing of those questions slightly, and
you could say, well.
Instead of fried, you could say, would you
like to
have your burger cooked on a hot stainless
steel grill?
Or, would you like to have it cooked by
passing raw meat through an open flame?
Which is just a different way of saying
flame-broiled.
Doesn't sound so appealing, though, does
it?
And in fact, the people who took the
survey agreed.
So now, 53% of the people want, cooked on
a
hot stainless steel grill, which is the
equivalent of fried.
The other people a much lower percentage
than
in the first survey now prefer the flame
broiled.
So just be a little bit careful as a
consumer when you're
exposed to any kind of claim on the basis
of a rational appeal.
Presumably that appeal has been created on
the basis of some
research but may have a slight slant one
way or the other.
Okay, so that's the end of rational
appeals or the
main categories of rational appeals and
when and how they're useful.
Notice at this point I haven't said
anything about the particular media.
And that's not really important at this
point
because you could have a rational appeal
in print.
You could have a rational appeal on an
advertisement sent to my mobile phone.
A rational appeal on a Facebook ad.
So, really you don't want to think too
much about
the delivery mechanism, but at this point,
just really
thinking about the ways that we can do
creative content.
