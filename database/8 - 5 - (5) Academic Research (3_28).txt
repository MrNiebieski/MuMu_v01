So now we're going to a delve a little bit
into the world of academic research.
One thing I really want to do as we go
through our discussion is to share with
you some of the interesting findings that
myself and
some of my other colleagues, not just at
the
Wharton School but throughout universities
around North America
and indeed around the world, have found
out about
how the virtual world of the Internet and
the
real world that we all live in still
interacts.
So let me share with you two interesting
research findings.
The first
has to do with content.
So remember I said earlier when you live
in a bigger town,
content becomes more important because
there's more things for you to do.
Furthermore, as the town gets larger, more
and more websites and
apps start to spring up to deliver content
that is purely local.
So one of my colleagues at the University
of
Pennsylvania did a very, very interesting
piece of research
where he found in the United States for
every
additional million residents that we have
in a city
there are at least another 50 or 60
websites
devoted just to things to do in that city.
So in my own city, for example, that would
be something like Philly To Do.
In a bigger town, more of those things are
springing up because
there's more information to be told and
there's more things going on.
The second result I want to share with you
from the same study is also very, very
interesting.
This is relating to product as opposed to
information.
So again, the further
you live from the physical store, the more
likely you are to buy from a virtual
store.
Now, that makes good sense, doesn't it?
If you live right next door to a drug
store,
perhaps you can just step in there and buy
your diapers.
By drug store, I mean a pharmacy if you
living in, different parts of the world.
I'm just using American nomenclature, even
though
I'm not yet an American citizen myself.
I thought I should clarify that.
So the further you live from a real store,
the
more likely you are to shop in a virtual
store, and
for every mile of distance that increases,
the probability that you
go onto a website and buy those same
products increases also.
So those are two very interesting findings
from academic research.
Now just to summarize, I'd like to show
you or share with you just a couple of
different things that show the real
benefits and
real advantages of what the virtual world
offers you.
So number one, the virtual world offers
you potentially lower prices and
lower search costs.
Fantastic.
You can find out where all the great deals
are and you can do it
all from the convenience of your own home
or from your tablet or your mobile phone.
Secondly, if you wanted to transact with
somebody in some other part of the
country or even other part of the world,
you can do that more efficiently.
Think of a business like eBay is
essentially allowing markets
to be matched whereas previously that
would not be possible.
The third thing that the virtual world
does to improve your life
in the physical world is it gives
you very specific information about local
stuff that's
going on, so you're more able to find that
great comedy club to go to.
You've got better information about that
restaurant in the center of your town
in terms of the quality of service and the
dishes and so on.
And then the fourth thing, the fourth
point is
also, you have much greater or improved
consumer convenience.
You can do the shopping 24/7.
Everything is transacted seamlessly
via an app or via a website.
So, those are the four things that the
virtual world is
really doing for you to improve your
experience in the physical world.
