So now let's move into emotional appeals,
really tugging at the heart strings.
So emotions can be both positive and
negative.
I'm going to start with the use of one of
the negative emotions.
It's actually proven to be very, very
effective, particularly in public service
kind of messages.
So you might want to stop people engaging
in
things like smoking cigarettes or things
like drinking and driving.
Things that have negative consequences.
Both for individuals and also for
societies as a whole.
And what's
really fascinating here about this
research, again if we think of a diagram.
Where on the X axis, is the amount of
fear that I'm putting into the commercial
from very, very
low fear to very, very high levels of
fear, maybe
even showing people in car accidents and
things like that
as a consequence of drinking and driving
that would
be very, very high fear appeal as opposed
to just
saying, yeah don't drink and drive it
might be bad
for you or you might get stopped by the
police.
So as you increase the
fear a little what researchers have found
over and over
again is something called an inverted U
relationship, if the Y
axis is effectiveness does the ad change
people's behavior, does
it change the way they think, does it
change their emotions.
A little bit of fear works as you increase
the fear the success of the
advertisement increases but if you make
the
thing too fearful then, the effectiveness
goes down.
So you have to be careful.
You have to pitch it just right.
If it's too aggressive, and to fearful,
what actually happens, again, this relates
back to many of the things Barbara said,
is customers have an adverse reaction.
Gee, well that's never going to happen to
me,
I'm not going to literally crash my car an
die.
And because, it seems too implausible,
then the advertisement becomes less
effective.
So be a little bit careful if your using
fear.
Sometimes fear and humor get's used
together I'm just putting up
a couple of slides for you to see so this
is a fashion brand in the UK there's a
gentlemen having
a shave, unfortunately the person who's
doing the shave is otherwise
preoccupied, same thing for the guy who's
mowing the lawns, okay.
Now in addition to negative emotions, of
which fear is
the most common, and certainly if you
think about particular
kinds of advertising like political
advertising, almost all of it
in the United States and perhaps around
the world is very,
very negative.
So negative fear based advertising can be
very, very effective if its done well.
I'm not necessarily endorsing it, but can
be very effective.
So, in addition to these negative emotions
like fear and disgust and anger
and other things that we can use, we can
also use positive emotions.
Good example of this was a great campaign
that was put together
by Procter and Gamble during the Summer
Olympics in 2012 in London.
And the whole idea was to say,
what a great job it is to be a mother.
And of course, all of the mothers that
were shown from different places around
the world were also people who were
engaging with and using Proctor and Gamble
products.
This was all shown, for example, not just
on television,
but through Facebook and other kinds of
social media channels.
Okay, now I want to conclude this part of
the
content with somewhat controversial form
of advertising it's called subliminal
advertising.
Now, subliminal advertising is interesting
because there is no clear research that
shows that it works or
that it doesn't work, so let me you one of
those urban legends.
So, one of the urban legends was way back
when in the 1960's
and 1970's, there were things called
drive-in movie theaters in the United
States.
I unfortunately never got to go to one.
I guess I didn't arrive here soon enough
unfortunately.
But the idea of sitting out in a
convertible watching
a movie and seeing that seemed like a
great experience.
So the idea was, that as the movie was
playing just before intermission because
you would have a
break halfway through the movie, there
would be one
screen that would just flash like this,
buy Coke.
And it was flashed so quickly that
you weren't able to really process it
consciously.
But the notion was you would run out at
halftime and buy Coca Cola.
Now whether or not this was true or really
worked is open to some debate.
It's probably a little bit of an urban
myth or
an urban legend.
However, companies still seem to place
some faith in it and try to use
it, so, maybe some of you out there are
doing it and practicing it.
If so, please do contribute that into our
discussion.
Related to that, I'm going to share a
little
bit of research from a friend of mine from
Duke University, Gavin Fitzsimons, which
goes in the other
way, which suggests maybe you could do
subliminal advertising.
So what Gavin did is he did a very clever
experiment at his lab down
in Duke University where he flashed at
very, very high frequency.
So fast that your brain couldn't really
register.
Various kinds of brand logos.
And what he found was really fascinating.
If I flash, again my friend Chris who's
really involved
in everything, and I flash him the brand
logo for Apple.
And then after he seen that logo even
though its been too fast for him
to process, I then give Chris a creativity
test it turns out he scores much
higher on that creativity test then other
people
who were just exposed to other kinds of
brands.
Quite controvercial, yet quite
fascinating.
So that's subliminal advertising, of
course if it really does work
then you'd have to be careful of ethical
issues, should you
really be trying to program people to do
things a against
their wishes or against them really
knowing what was going on.
So now let me just spend a little bit of
time talking about
two very, very important pieces but we're
not going to go into them
in detail, but I really encourage you to
think carefully as possible about these.
If you're executing your own campaign.
First of all is, how much money should be
spent?
And second, how should we in fact measure
the
success both of the commercial and also
the outcome
that we're trying to, to affect, as I
mentioned
at the beginning when we did the milk
example.
So what are the most common methods that
people use for
setting marketing budgets?
Well, there's a couple that aren't
particular good
and very, very common sometimes people
will say,
well I'm going to spend some percentage of
my
sales on marketing that's a really bad
idea.
Now why is that a bad idea, its a
bad idea because of the problem of reverse
causality.
What do I mean by that, well if you are
having
your sales numbers drive your advertising
budget, but of course your advertising
is also driving your sales.
Everything is always, is a little bit back
to front.
So, percentage of sales is common, but
it's not a particularly good method to
use.
The second method you might use is
you might say, gee, what's my competitor
doing.
Let me match my competitor or go a little
bit above or go a little bit below.
Of course that's not a good thing to do,
either, because,
well perhaps, the competitor doesn't know
any more than you do.
So ideally, what we encourage you to do is
to think
about the outcome that you're trying to
achieve and the amount
of money that needs to be spent in order
to accomplish it.
So, what do I mean by that?
Let me give you a couple of examples and
work through those.
The first one is an example, but you can
work out with a
little bit of pen and paper kind
of mathematics, that's called the
Parfitt-Collins model.
The Parfitt-Collins model is really,
really simple.
It just says, I've done some calculation,
and I've determined that I need to get a
6% market share in order to break even.
So if I need 6% market share to break
even, then how many people would have
to know about my product and try my
product in order for that to actually
happen.
Well, let's say I go out and I do a little
bit of
market research and I find out that 30% of
the people who are aware
of the product will actually try it three
out of ten, and then
I find out that of those who try not
everyone's going to continue but 40%
of the triers will continue and become
repeat customers.
So now, its actually a very simple
equation to
figure out how many people must the
advertisement make
aware of the product to begin with in
order
for me to beat my goal of 6% market share.
So I'm showing on the slide here the
simple equation
that we need to solve, so we just need to
figure out the percentage of people that
need to be
made aware by using the three other pieces
of information.
So on the right hand side of the equation
we have 6% market share, that's our goal.
On the left-hand side we have some unknown
number, how many
people need to be, made aware of our
product through advertising.
And we have two known numbers, we know
that 30% of
the people who try I'm sorry, who are
aware will try.
And we know that 40% of the people who try
will repeat.
So now we have, in the simplified
terms, some unknown number of people or
percentage
of people that need to be aware, multiply
it by 12%, has to equal 6%.
What's the missing number?
The missing number is 50%.
So in order for your objective to be met,
you would have to generate 50% awareness.
That gets you to start thinking about, gee
how much would
I need to spend in order to create that
level of awareness.
What method of marketing communication
communication
would I, in fact, have to use?
So again, this is not perfect but it
forces you
to think about what's actually required in
terms of measurable results.
So what I want to really reinforce to you
out there if you're
thinking about spending money on marketing
communications,
is to think about the goal that
needs to be achieved and then kind of work
backwards to figure out
approximately how much money would need to
be spent in order to do that.
So, in terms of measuring whether or not
advertisements are
effective or marketing communications are
effective, is really a whole
spectrum of things we can do.
From running an experiment where we do a
marketing communication on one
market but not the other and we look at
the difference in sales.
From doing things like asking people in
surveys how they feel about our brand
after they've been exposed to a new
communication, as opposed to how they felt
before.
To all sorts of other things, for example,
even measuring where their eyes
are going on a screen, measuring their
click through rates on a device.
Measuring how
long they look at an ad, if they're
viewing it on a tablet or a mobile phone.
So really there's a whole gamut.
And what I would encourage you to do, is
to think about the
method or metric that's going to be
appropriate for the ad that you're
running.
