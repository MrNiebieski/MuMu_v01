Alright, we are back and now, we are going
to talk about customer retention.
And, I hope you know where I am going with
this.
There is really two themes, I'm going to
see through all of these discussions.
I'm going to begin by asking the same
exact question that I asked about customer
acquisition.
Which is, what metric do we use to guage
and guide our retention activities?
And so, once again, there's a very common
metric out there.
In fact, it goes by several
different names.
Some companies call it a retention rate.
Some call it a turn rate, or an attrition
rate.
Let's just explain what it is, real
quickly, although you
probably get the idea if you're not
familiar with it already.
We look at all the customers we had, say,
at the beginning of the period.
We ask ourselves, how many of them stay
with us.
So, what percent, of that original chunk
of customers, stayed with us?
That's the retention rate.
Of course, we can look at what percent of
customers left.
And, that goes by different names, as I
said.
A churn rate, or an attrition rate.
So either way, whether you look at the,
the glass as half full, or half empty.
it's that kind of metric that, that firms
use to say,
how good a job are we doing at keeping our
existing customers?
So, again, very common metric and here's
my view on it.
Unlike CPA, cost per
acquisition, which I view as a very bad
metric.
I see the retention rate, or the churn
rate, as a pretty good metric.
But, you have to be careful about how you
look at it,
how you use it, and how you make decisions
based on it.
So, I'm going to start with a real world
example.
One of the things that I like to do, is I
like to look at
the information that public companies put
out there,
about their retention rates or their
attrition rates.
What do they say,
about how many of their customers stick
around?
And, what implications does it have?
How do they manage.
Around the attrition rates.
Instead of viewing it as just a nice to
know number.
Let's understand, how we can, actually,
use that information, to go all the
way, to even coming up with a financial
value of the entire customer base.
So, so, here's the example that I'd like
to work with.
The example comes from Vodafone, a big
cellphone operator, I'm sure many of
you are familiar with.
and, and they actually puts statements out
there to their investors to
say, here's our attrition rate, and here's
how it varies over time.
And so you can see the graphic right here.
And, and from a very, kind of, quick look.
It appears that their attrition rate, on
an annualized basis, as we
look at it from one quarter to another, is
around 20%, okay?
A little, a little bit lower,
but around 20%.
So, let's think for a second about what
that means.
Okay, so, if if we're losing around 20% of
our customers, at any given time.
How long do we expect those customers to
stay with us?
Pretty simple math question, but let me
make it even simpler.
Suppose the attrition rate with 50%.
Okay, suppose we're loosing half our
customers every period, God forbid.
Then, how long is a typical customer
staying
with us.
So, if our attrition rate is 50%, then
a typical life time would be around, two
years.
Right?
So, if the attrition rates's around 20%.
The typical lifetime is around 5 years.
It's a little bit less than 20%.
It'll be a little bit greater than 5
years.
So, if we want to come up with, kind of, a
quick and
dirty evaluation, not just for a given
customer, but for the entire customer
base.
If our attrition rate is a little under
20%, it
means, the typical customer's with us a
little over 5 years.
We can multiply that by the amount of
revenue, per customer.
Multiply that by the size of the customer
base, and
boom, that's our customer equity, that's
the value of the firm.
At least, again, as a, as a first pass
approximation.
And, I don't want to I don't want to
understate that.
There's a lot of companies out there, that
are
doing, exactly, that kind of calculation,
to
figure out what their customers are worth.
So, here's my question.
What's wrong with this picture?
And, that sounds like a very nice
calculation right?
It's great to see their attrition rate.
But, what's wrong with it?
What's missing?
What is it, that we really want to see?
I contend that it's not enough to see
their
attrition rate, for the customer, base as
a whole.
But, what is it that we celebrate
in the customer-centric world?
You got it, we celebrate heterogeneity,
right?
We don't want to, just, see a single
number.
We don't want to say what, what is the
attrition rate
look like for an average customer,
because, there is no average customer.
We want to know how that attrition rate,
how that attrition propensity varies
across the customers.
So, here's what I want you to think
about, and this is a very, very important
question.
How does, the attrition propensity varies
across the customers?
Just imagine, if we can reach into the
mind
of each and every customer, and pull out
just how.
Churn prone, or not churn prone, they are.
Okay, how likely they are to leave at, at
any given time.
And, we look at that, tho, those numbers
across the customer base.
What will that distribution look like?
Kay, will we tend to have a lot of very
churn-prone customers?
Will we have a lot of customers, who tend
to stick around for awhile?
Will it be kind of a nice, bell-shaped
normal distribution?
Who knows?
Well I know, and you know.
And, I think its a very important
question.
So, let me show you what it looks like for
Vodafone.
But, before I do, I want to emphasize to
you, that
the, the figure you're about to see is,
actually, very, very typical.
This is the basic shape that we see, for
almost all businesses.
Not just in telecommunications.
Not just for a phone company that, that
primarily operates in Europe.
But for, pretty much, any company that
operates on some kind
of contractual sub, subscription basis,
and here it what it looks like.
Here is the celebration of heterogeneity
for Vodafone.
So, don't ask me where the numbers come
from, again, it comes from,
these are numbers that Vodafone calculated
on their own.
And, to their credit, shared with their
investors.
And, they broke their customer base into
three groups.
And, they found that these three groups
vary
in terms of their return, or attrition
rates.
They found that there's one real small
group, that has a very high attrition
rate.
Kay, so those are people who are very,
very
likely to leave at, you know, the next
possible opportunity.
And then, there's this middle size, middle
attrition
group, and then, there's this largest
group to
the left, that has a fairly low attrition
rate.
So, first thing I want to ask is, is this
good
news or bad news, for Votafone and for
most companies.
And the answer is.
Yeah, it's pretty good news.
It suggests that most of their companies,
most of the customers tend to
stick around for awhile and, and don't
have a propensity to leave right away.
Now, the next question is, why is that?
Why,
I mean, again, it's great to know.
But, but, what is it about those
customers?
What words would be used to describe
the customers, with the fairly low
attrition rates?
What most companies, what most managers,
like to use, would be a word like, loyal.
Those customers are really loyal.
They love us.
They'll run through the gates of Hell to
stay with us!
Maybe.
That's probably true for some of the
customers.
But, what other words
could we use to describe them?
How about words like lazy, inertial,
indifferent?
Maybe, they just don't care very much.
They're not very involved with this
particular product or service.
They're working with the service provider,
and it doesn't really matter
enough to them, to decide whether to stay
or whether to go.
They just don't care very much.
Now, I don't know what the breakdown is
here.
We have this big bar to the left.
Some of them are loyal, some of them are
lazy.
I don't know.
And, for the purpose of this exercise, I
don't necessarily care.
But, I do want to emphasize, that when we
see all
of those customers, who tend to have a low
attrition rate.
It's not necessarily a reflection of great
marketing or
strong branding on our part, although it
might be.
It might be that a lot of customers just
don't care very much.
And so, let's, let's keep that in mind.
So,
here's my question, now that we
celebrating heterogeneity, what difference
does it make?
How are we going to use the information,
that you see
on this chart, in order to make a more
informed assessment.
Of what the customer base is worth.
So, let me make it a little bit easier for
you.
In addition to the graph, I'm just
going to look
carefully at the graph, and pick off the
various numbers.
You see this table over here, that shows
you both the size
of each of the three groups.
What percent of the customer base is
associated, with each of the three groups.
And the attrition rate okay, again, as we
see
the a high medium low risk of, of, of
churning.
So, let's do the math right now.
In fact, take a moment to think about how
you would take this information that's in
front of you.
And, combine it together in order to come
up with an overall value of the customer
base, what would you do?
Think about that.
Okay, let's talk about the calculation.
Here is what I suspect most of you did.
You probably took a weighted average.
You said, look we understand the breakdown
of our customer base,
70%, 20%, 10% into the low, medium, and
high risk groups.
And then, they have their associated
attrition rates.
And so, you took this simple weighted
average.
You multiply 0.7 by 0.06, and so on, and
so on, and
so on.
You did the calculation and, as it says
right
here, the overall average attrition rate
would be 17.7%.
And, what does that average attrition rate
tell
us about the overall length of the
customers life?
And therefore, the overall financial value
of the customer base.
Well once again, 1 over 17.7%, do that
calculation, you get 5.6 years.
Well, that sounds kind of familiar, right?
Isn't that just about the same number,
that we got, when we didn't celebrate
heterogeneity.
So, what difference does it make?
Why is taking heterogeneity into account,
going to help us at all here?
I'll tell you why, because you did the
wrong calculation.
You did calculate an overall average but,
like,
we've said before, there is no average
customer.
Telling me that the average attrition rate
is 17.7%, doesn't do me any good.
Because, there is no customer out there,
at least, according
to the Vodafone analysis, who has that
kind of attrition rate.
So, we've just calculated an expected
lifetime, an expected
financial value, for a customer who does
not exist.
So, the question is, what's wrong with
this calculation?
How do we do it the right way?
How do we, truly celebrate heterogeneity?
because what we did, here, is we
eliminated
heterogeneity, we just squashed it all
together and said...
heterogeneity is gone, and that's why we
ended up getting the same result.
That we would have gotten, if we didn't
look at heterogeneity
[LAUGH]
in the first place.
So, what's wrong with this calculation,
and what's the right way to do it.
So, think about that for a moment.
And then, I'll give you a super big hint
from one
of the world's leading thinkers about
customer loyalty, and so on.
So, let's turn to the words of Frederick
Reichheld, who, a
number of years ago, wrote a book called,
The Loyalty Effect.
And, he laid out so many, many good
ideas about what loyalty is, how we
measure it, how we capture it.
He's a consultant for Bain, so, so not an
academic.
So, he's really seen loyalty in action,
and has
helped a lot of companies create and
monetize it.
And, here's the quote from Reicheld, and
you can, you can see
it here, and I hope the logic makes a lot
of sense.
The average makes no sense at all.
We need to do the calculations
separately, group by group.
Okay, so, that's where the celebration of
heterogeneity is going to come in.
Let's understand the separate value for
the high, medium, and low,
and then combine them together, instead of
combining them together first.
I hope that makes sense.
Perhaps, your inclination is to say, seems
kind of similar.
You know, let's take an average, and then,
calculate the lifetime.
Or, let's calculate a lifetime,
then take an average, seems kind of
similar.
Well, you know what?
It's not.
So, let's revisit this example, but do the
lifetime calculation, first.
Okay, so for our low risk customers, their
average attrition rate is 0.06.
So, what does that mean, just for those
customers,
how long are they going to stick around,
on average?
So what's 1 over .06?
Well, as you can see here, its about 16.7
years.
And, if we repeat that calculation for the
other two
groups, we can see what their expected
life time would be.
And here, you see the, really, dramatic
differences.
This is the celebration of heterogeneity.
We see an, order of magnitude difference
between the best and the worst customers.
We don't want to ignore that, we don't
want to eliminate that,
we don't want to average over that, we
want to celebrate that.
Once we see the expected life times,
for each of these different customer
groups.
Then, let's take the weighted average.
Then, we'll multiply by 70, 20, and 10%,
and when we do that, what do we get?
Our overall expected lifetime for this
customer base, 12.4 years.
That's a big difference, I'm sure you'll
agree.
So, instead of doing the calculation the
wrong
way, where we, where we weren't
celebrating heterogeneity.
Once, we acknowledge and, and explicitly
take into account heterogeneity.
We have, more than doubled, the value of
our customer base.
Just like that.
Not by doing anything, just by doing the
correct calculation.
This is the celebration of heterogeneity.
Now, you might be wondering, alright, so,
this is this Vodafone example.
How does this work in general?
Answer?
Always works the same way.
Whenever there's any heterogeneity at all,
any spread
among the customers, in terms of their
attrition rates.
There will always be, money left on the
table, if we ignore heterogeneity.
We will always understate the value of the
customer base, by ignoring heterogeneity.
The only question is, how much?
So, in this case, it's a, more than,
twofold increase.
And, as you might imagine
the, the magnitude of that increase
depends entirely
on, the magnitude, and nature of the
heterogeneity.
So, if we, if the customers are more
spread out.
Then, ignoring heterogeneity is going to
cause us
to even steeper, understatement of the
customer value.
So, again, it's not a question of whether
it will occur.
It's not a question of whether it will be
an overstatement, or an understatement.
It always
works this way.
It's just a question of how much.
Now, if that's not a celebration of
heterogeneity, then, I don't know what it
is.
But, this shows you, that by explicitly
accounting for heterogeneity.
By really understanding the differences
among our
good customers, and our not so good
customers.
We have just doubled the value in our
company.
Now, you might wonder, so, what are the
implications of that, for managing our
customer base, and
this is really, really important.
Especially, for all of you who voted for
customer retention, as
the activity that we should be putting our
incremental dollars on.
So, let's summarize our thinking about
customer retention, and there, there's
two really important points that I want to
make, over here.
First and foremost, there is no "average"
customer, and
you can't do calculations based on an
average customer.
Yes, it's easy, yes, it's convenient, but
its wrong.
You will understate the value of your
customer base, and
that difference can be huge, if you ignore
the heterogeneity.
And here's a second point, that's much
more subtle,
and I'll spare you the painful math to get
there.
But, if we ever want to calculate an
elasticity, if we
ever want to find out, what's the
incremental gain that we get.
For say, a 1%
reduction in the attrition rate.
It turns out, we can do that calculation
two ways.
If we do it by ignoring heterogeneity, as
many firms do.
Or, if we do it by taking heterogeneity
into account,
as we just did, we get a very different
conclusion.
So, in some of my research, we've actually
done that calculation separately.
And, we show that the, the, the retention
elasticity, the gain that we get by
lowering the attrition rate by
one percent, is much, much less.
When you account for heterogeneity.
Which means that, efforts to boost
retention, or decrease attrition,
or churn are, are much more modest, then
you think they are.
Once you've exclusively account for
heterogeneity.
Now, I want to
be, really, clear about this.
I am not saying that you should stop
spending
on retention, no, I am not saying that at
all.
Okay, retention is one of our three major
pillars of customer centricity.
It is very, very important.
You want to figure out who the good
customers are and make,
and do whatever it takes to keep them
around, for a long time.
You must do that, but at the margin,
companies seem
to want to spend more, and more, and more
on retention.
That seems to be the constraint
for them.
I contend, that some companies, might,
actually, be overspending on retention.
And, taking some of those retention
dollars, which are
often being allocated to customers who
aren't really that great.
To customers, who have a fairly high
attrition rate,
and are always going to have a high
attrition rate.
And, even if we kind of bribe them, or
incent them, to stay around for another
year or two.
They're going to leave at the first
opportunity, after that.
We're better off takin' some of those
dollars and spending them where?
Customer acquisition.
Let's spend some of those dollars, finding
new customers, who might be really good.
So, so, right away you're starting to see
some of the implications.
Some of the trade-offs between,
acquisition and retention, that
arise, when we have an explicit focus on
heterogeneity.
So, that's the retention story.
Let's take a short break, and come back,
and talk about customer development.
