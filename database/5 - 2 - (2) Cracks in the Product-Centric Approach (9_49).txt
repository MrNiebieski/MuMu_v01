Okay, so we've reviewed the
product-centric approach to business.
We understand that for most companies,
again those focusing
on performance priority, or operational
excellence, it's all about coming
in with that blockbuster idea, reducing a
lot of it,
keeping the cost down, and using
appropriate metrics for it.
And we call that product centricity.
Now, we're going to start talking about
some alternative
approaches, but I don't want to suggest
that product centricity
is doomed to fail.
I don't want to suggest that all companies
must move away from product-centricity.
I don't want to suggest that that's a
recipe for disaster.
But I do want to suggest that there are
some aspects of
product-centricity that make it not quite
as great as it used to be.
So as you can on this slide over here, I
like to say that there are some cracks in
product-centricity.
There are just a, a, a number of trends
going on
today, things that didn't really exist say
15 or 20 years ago.
That make the product-centric approach
just a little
bit less, guaranteed successful than it
was back then.
In fact, I'd like you to just take a, a
minute or two think about what
are some of the changes, today, compared
to 15 or 20 years ago, that make product
centricity just a little bit different?
That take some of the shine off it, that
take some of that automatic kaching, away
from being product-centric.
What would be some of the emerging trends?
Most of which are trends that are here
to stay, that might make a company think
twice
about whether they want to focus on
product-centricity,
or start looking towards a different kind
of strategy.
Take a moment and think about
that, and then we'll run down a list of
some of the
leading factors that, that take some of
the edge off of product-centricity.
So I bet first and foremost on everyones
list, is the idea of commoditization.
See back in the old days, it was so hard
to come
up with and, and manufacture a new
product, or deliver a service.
That you would stay steps ahead of all of
your
competitors for a long period of time
before
they could come, come up with an
equivalent idea.
But today, because of technology, things
commoditize much more quickly.
Product life cycles are getting much, much
shorter.
Companies know that as soon as they launch
something new,
they have to have the next new thing
already in process.
So this idea of commoditization,
takes away some of the goodness of
product-centricity.
Here's a way of thinking about it.
In the product-centric world, every
company is
counting on some kind of natural monopoly.
We're doing something that's going to keep
us ahead of
all of our competitors for a long period
of time.
And that's what's going to let us focus on
the
dev, developing the best of delivering the
most efficient.
But as those life cycles shorten, as
things commoditize,
it takes away some of that natural
monopoly power.
But that's just one reason.
It's a big one, but by no means the only.
Another important reason would be changes
on the customer side.
Our customers are so much smarter, more
informed than ever before.
It used to be that our customers were much
more passive.
They would take whatever products or
services that we would give
them, and they would say, oh, that's
great, terrific, thanks very much,
I'll figure out how to use it.
But today's customers are much different
from yesterday's customers.
They're much more informed.
They're much more demanding.
And they're much savvier.
And again, a big reason for this is, the
internet.
Information technology.
Customers are so much more aware of
options that are available
to them, or options that might not yet be
available to them.
But that they, they clamor for than they
ever were before.
Again, the customers aren't passive, like
they use to be.
So smarter customers put much more demands
on, on companies.
And make it harder for them to extract as
much
value out of the products and services
that they deliver.
And a third way that technology makes life
a little bit more difficult for
product-centric companies, is, is the idea
that
products are, are now available everywhere
instantaneously.
If you
think about what FedEx, or DHL, or UPS,
does they take
away some of that natural monopoly power
that a company had.
In the old days, companies would rely on
the
fact that no one else had a product like
them.
But even if other companies did have a
product like them, customers wouldn't be
aware of it.
And even if customers were aware of it,
customers wouldn't have access to it.
But today, because distribution technology
brings everything, everywhere overnight if
you want
it, it's much harder to protect yourself
from other products and services that are,
that are available in, in in other
regions.
So there's all kinds of ways that
technology
takes some of the, the edge off
product-centricity.
But by no means is it limited to
technology.
Part of it is a mindset.
People are thinking globally much
more than ever before.
So, so customers are, are much more
actively looking for
products and services from other regions
than they ever were before.
And then there's the issue of
deregulation.
Again, regulation was a way that gave
companies monopoly power.
That they were the only game in town and
customers had no choice.
But as one industry after another
deregulates,
companies need to be much more
competitive.
And it's much harder to stay a step ahead.
And in some cases, it's not deregulation,
but it's re-regulation.
It's regulations that are making markets
much more competitive.
So, again, that's another reason why
product-centricity
just isn't what it used to be.
A sixth reason comes back to the customer
again.
Not only is the customer smarter, but as
I mentioned before, customers are far more
demanding than
they ever were before.
So in the old days, it was good enough
just for, to, to let the customer
take a bunch of products and services and
figure out what they're going to do with
it.
Figure out how those different products
and services are
going to help them solve the problems that
they have.
But today's customer is much more
demanding, and is insisting that companies
not
only deliver them one product or service
at a time, but, but bundled together
products and services.
Sometimes, including products and services
that the
company might not make any money on.
It is now much more imperative than it
ever was
before for companies to be seen as a
trusted advisor.
To be providing full fledged solutions to
the customer and not just piece
meal products and services that the
customer
will figure out how to combine together.
One of the great stories along these lines
is that of IBM.
IBM, which of course stands for
International Business Machines,
used to be one of the ultimate
product-centric firms.
They were just the best at coming up with,
and developing certain
kinds of products, business machines,
computers
and so on, better than anybody else.
But they had a revelation in the mid
1990s, that
they could actually make more money being
a trusted advisor.
Instead of saying here, customer, buy our
machine, telling a customer what set
of machines and services to be buying.
That there are actually higher margins,
especially as computers and other
information
technology equipment commoditizes, they
can actually
do better being a solution advisor.
And slowly but surely, as many of you
know, IBM spun off many of its business
machines.
They no longer manufacture personal
computers.
their, their presence in most other
hardware areas
has diminished.
But where they're making their money
today,
is from being a customer centric solution
provider.
Is going to the customer and saying, here
are
the set of products and services you
should be buying.
And that kind of expertise doesn't
commoditize
nearly as much as any one product might.
And so that idea of moving away from just
selling products,
to being a full scale solution provider is
a major change
in the last 15 to 20 years.
And there's one more point that I want to
talk about with you.
And it's not necessarily the most
important crack in product-centricity,
but it's one that I like to think about a
lot.
And that's the data.
See, today's technology enables us to
collect and manage, and utilize data
about customers, in a way that we just
could have never imagined before.
So if you think about old companies.
Think about Henry Ford, who was one
of the, the real originators of
product-centric thinking.
He had no idea how many customers he had.
He didn't know whether he was selling one
car to each of ten
million different people, or whether he
was
selling ten million cars to one person.
He didn't know.
And frankly he didn't care that much.
Because he was so product-centric in his
thinking,
that it was just a matter of turning
that crank, of pushing products out the
door.
Of keeping the volumes up and keeping the
costs down.
But today given these other cracks and
product-centricity, it's much more
important for companies to be using the
data about their customers.
To be understanding who's buying what.
And for how long, and what other products
that they're buying.
So the information systems give us the
possibility of developing business models
that were unimaginable before.
But could actually be more successful than
the product-centric approach.
And I want to give you a couple of
examples of that.
