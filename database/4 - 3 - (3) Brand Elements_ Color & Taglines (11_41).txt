Now that we
discussed brand name, let's think about
some of the other elements that can go
around a brand name and I'm going to talk
about two that are extremely important.
One is choosing a color.
And color has very, very strong perceptual
cues.
We'll show you some of those things,
but people associate a lot with different
colors.
And the other is this notion of choosing a
slogan or
a tagline, which can add additional
meaning to the brand name.
So let's start with color first.
There's a few rules about color that you
should think about.
First of all, the best use of color if you
can possibly get it, is to own a color.
and that's not, very many brands can do
it.
There aren't that many colors out there
and to
really own a color is pretty hard to do.
But, when you do it it's extremely
powerful.
If you think about Tiffany's, and they own
the light
blue color box, you know this is a
globally known,
this light blue box.
This is such an important cue, that the
Tiffany empty boxes are sold on Ebay.
And people will purchase those boxes, and
then put
another product, maybe not a Tiffany
piece, in that product.
But, people getting a gift in a Tiffany
box,
this just shows you how strong the
perception is.
We'll think the product in side that box
is higher quality.
But Tiffany's light blue box is extremely
valuable brand
image for their, I mean it's very high
quality, and,
and, many times with jewelry, unless your
an expert it's
kind of hard to necessarily judge quality
so people will use
this light blue box as a cue for high
quality products.
Mary Kay owns the pink color.
That's, it's a very feminine business,
cosmetics.
Mary Kay gives away pink Cadillacs to
their sales people.
and she has really used that bright pink,
that to,
to symbolize her business, and it's been
very strong.
color can also be used within a brand to
separate product lines.
So, different American Express has
different colored cards.
The green card, the black card, the silver
card, all these different kinds of cards.
and you, you infer different qualities to
the card as a function of its color.
And that's used in lots of different
products, as well.
you have to be careful with color,
because color can be experienced
differently it
can be experienced differently across
different platforms.
So a lot of times if you're going to test
a color you want to test it
on a computer, on a phone, in real life,
and the colors may vary a little bit.
And when you want a color to really be
identifiable with a
particular brand, you want to make sure
you have that consistent color across.
and colors also can create very strong
perceptions.
If, if you look at a product line and you
see
some of the products or it's gold or
silver or black
and white, that cues luxury, and you just
assume that product's
more expensive than more basic colors like
a red and blue.
So that those colors can just signal high
quality just because it's gold and silver.
Similarly, you see something that's blue
or pink, you think female or male.
just by the color, can be the exact same
product but the color changes and you
think it's for girls versus boys.
So we know some theory about color.
We know that there's two basic axes of
color.
There's the arousal axis, you know, how
stimulating it is, versus how calming it
is.
And there's the affect axis, which means
how much people like it or don't like it.
The affect axis is extremely important,
but it does vary a little bit by cultures.
Some colors are better liked
in some cultures than others.
But what I'll show you here is kind of the
way the
U.S. looks at it, and it may be different
in different cultures.
It is true that high arousal colors are
like red and orange.
those ha-, create much more tension, much
more
excitement, and common colors are more
blue and green.
That's pretty universal.
but then also, if you think about, on that
affect, or that liking dimension, the
blues and greens
tend to be better liked colors in the U.S.
where oranges and yellows are a
little bit less liked in the U.S. And this
may be different in other cultures.
For example, orange is a very popular
color in India.
There's other rules about colors.
But there's been a, color's an interesting
thing.
And, there's been a lot of research on
color.
and so there's certain things that we know
of that the
way people automatically react to these
colors going back to that perception.
So, red for example, as I mentioned
is an exciting color.
It can, it gets attention.
It's part of the reason why fire engines
are red.
Or sometimes they're yellow.
Both of them are very attention-getting
colors.
Red also means love.
It means passion.
But red also stimulates appetite.
And so you'll see a lot of food logos like
McDonald's, Pizza Hut, K, KFC, Windows,
Chipotle, Windows, Wendy's, Chipotle.
They all stimulate appetite, and they all
have a lot of red in their logo.
Blue, on the other hand, is a calming
color and
it is not a good color for food, for food.
Blue actually is a color that curbs
appetite and
some people have said that if you're on a
diet
and you want to like try not to eat as
much, having blue plates can curb your
appetite a little.
blue, as I mentioned, is also a color
that's frequently preferred by men.
Green is a color that's tranquil.
It means health.
It can mean money.
It can mean nature.
A lot of environmental companies use the
green color to give you that green notion.
But green also means fertility.
And if you've seen some of the recent
M&M's ads.
And you know, Miss Green, you know?
She's a pretty sexy M&M.
And that's also that green color.
Brown is reliable, bor-, a little bit
boring, practical earth.
White is an interesting color,
because white can mean purity, it can mean
innocence.
people play around with white space.
They can, it can be high design, if
there's a lot of white space.
the spacious, is, issue.
People there's a lot of things that are
done with white, white's a very
interesting color.
Black, on the other hand, sometimes is
seen as
evil, you know, it, it can symbolize in
some cultures
death or mourning but, you know, people
wear a
lot of black because they think it creates
the perception
that they're thinner.
yellow is a very bright color.
It creates a lot of energy.
It has been shown, and this is somewhat
interesting, that yellow can sometimes
make babies cry.
So, it's kind of maybe not the best color
to paint for a newborn's room.
Orange is exciting, warm, it, it's, it, an
enthusiastic color.
Lavender on the other hand, is calming,
more relaxing.
Purple is associated
with royalty, with wealth, with wisdom.
And pink as I mentioned is more of a
girl's co, color.
It, it's warm.
It's a calming color.
very feminine.
And so one of the things you can look at
is look at
some of these different colors and
see which companies use these different
colors.
So you know, the bright yellow color is
used on Nike, on Shell Oil, on Best Buy,
on McDonald's, to get, on DHL, to get a
lot of attention.
The friendly fun orange color is used on
Hooters and Nickelodeon and Firefox.
The red colors I already mentioned is used
on
a lot of food companies like Kelloggs,
Coca Cola.
It's also used to get attention.
CNN uses it Netflix has used it.
I've showed you before Virgin uses it.
Purple is more of a creative color.
So, you see Yahoo using
it, Barbie uses it, Hallmark, Taco Bell.
Blue is this trust color.
So, companies like Oral B, Walmart, IBM,
Pfizer.
You don't, American Express, GE, a lot of
really solid companies, not a lot of food
companies.
Again, green is more of this natural
color, Whole Foods
uses it some, Starbucks uses it, some of
the oil companies
have used it to show that they have
environmental leanings, BP has tried to
use it.
and then the grey, black and white colors
are more of a balance colors.
So you see New York Times is a black logo.
Apple sometimes has a silver apple.
Mercedes Benz is a silver kind of color.
So those colors silver, and things like
that are more balanced.
But if you look at the logos and start
thinking about them.
And thinking about how the colors are
working, we
kind of get a sense of what's going on
here.
So let's look now, at symbols.
And symbols as I mentioned, Mickey Mouse
is a very famous symbol.
Symbols can add a lot of fun, a lot of
attention to a brand.
I had some symbols here on the slide.
Mr. Clean is a symbol that communicates
certain types of associations.
Mr. Clean is a product for cleaning up.
And what they show is a strong muscular
man, so it's assuming that you can have a
lot of strength in this product.
The next one I showed you here is Wells
Fargo.
There's a lot of multiple associations
with
the Wells Fargo that shows independence,
the wild
west adventure and so there's other kinds
of things that you can associate with it.
Charlie the Tuna is the last one, it
invokes positive
feelings, liking Pillsbury's Dough Boy is
kind of like that.
And so you can just have fun with these
different symbols.
But, the symbols can get out of date and
in the last section
in this, we'll talk about how you can
reposition and rechange these symbols.
Symbols, because they can get dated and
they
can be very much tied to a particular era.
So you have to be careful with symbols.
Slogans can be tailored to help
the positioning strategy, we talked about
earlier.
So that,
you have a brand name and you want to
really communicate that brand mantra.
One way you can do it is through your
positioning strategy.
And sometimes, if you just have, you know,
these brand elements, you may want a
slogan or
a tagline that can help remove some of the
ambiguity that's associated with the brand
or the symbol.
And it's also, the tagline can create its
own emotion, like, "reach out and touch
someone" or,
you know, can create its own kind of
warmth and emotion.
and finally, the brand or the tagline can
reinforce the name or the symbol.
and can just, because if you have these
redundancy in
the tagline, is reinforcing the imagery,
or the brand name.
You're seeing this multiple times, it
makes for a very strong message.
Some of the basics about taglines, you
want them short.
It's similar to a brand
mantra, they have to be very short.
You really want em differentiated, if they
all
sound the same they don't do anything, so
you have to make sure it's not the same,
or would be confused with the competition.
Similarly it should be unique, it should
be easy to say and easy to remember.
you don't want it to have any negative
interpretations, so you
have to market test it, particularly when
you go across cultures.
and again, if you have a really
great tagline like "just do it" you want
to trademark it so that it's protected.
And as I mentioned, an emotion if you can
evoke
an emotion with your tagline, that will
make it much stronger.
So what are the different types of
taglines?
Well there's Imperative.
Just Do It, Think, Invent!
You know, those kinds of things, so
they're telling you what to do.
There's Descriptive, which adds more
information.
Moving at the Speed of Business, bullish
on America, You're
in Good Hands.
They can be Superlative.
The Ultimate Driving Machine.
There's no Better Way to Fly.
Those kinds of things.
Or they can be Provocative and kind of
clever.
Got Milk?
was one of those and clever.
Another clever one is what VW (Volkswagen)
have done with their slogan.
Drivers Wanted.
