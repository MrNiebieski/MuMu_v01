So, today we're going to talk about the
customer decision making process.
If a brand really wants to be a strong
brand and chosen by the customers.
It's very important to understand how
customers make decisions.
And in today's world, it's an omni channel
world.
People make decisions in the store, they
make
decisions on line, they make decisions
using their telephone.
And so, we really have to understand the
customer decision making process in
order to build strong brands.
In the first section, we're going to
define what shopper marketing is.
We're going to define the customer
decision making
process and recognize that it's a stage
process.
And we're going to talk about this process
being 24/7 in an omni channel world.
So first what is shopper marketing?
Today brands understand that in order to,
to really be the brand of choice,
you have to understand what happens when a
consumer becomes a shopper.
and that means the consumer is ready to
make a purchase.
And so shopper marketing is understanding
the decision making process from
a shopper point-of-view, understanding
that consumers
or shoppers make impulse purchase
decisions.
They buy on habit.
They buy on emotion.
They buy on intuition.
They make decisions based on what they see
and what they don't see.
And they think of the shopping process in
terms of what is personally relevant to
them.
Who am, who am I shopping for?
When do I use it?
The, the brand has to be in the shopper's
life in order to make sense to the
shopper.
And this shopper process, this
shopping process is a
multi-stage/multi-channeled process.
So what are the stages of the buying
process?
It's not that
someone just goes into the store and makes
a purchase.
It actually occurs in many different
stages.
First, the consumer has to understand that
they have a need,
and that this need can be satisfied by
making a purchase.
That's when they turn into a shopper.
Then, once they discover they have a need
that can be satisfied by
making a purchase, they need to identify
products that will satisfy that need.
They need to get information about those
products.
They need to evaluate those products,
purchase
the products once they make the
evaluation.
and then once they purchase it, they use
the product,
they relate to the product, they decide if
the product
was good or not, and then they decide
whether they're
going to repurchase the product or tell
somebody else about the product.
So those are the different stages of the
buying process.
And again, in today's world, though, this
process is not just done offline.
It's an omni channel process, so you may
discover you have a need from your phone.
You may look for information about the
brand or vet the
different products you're considering on
your phone, online, in the actual store.
It may be through advertising.
and all of these different stages can
occur
in all different media, either online or
offline.
Furthermore, in today's world the buying
process, or the shopping
process, can take place 24/7.
In the daytime, you may actually go to an
actual store to make a
purchase, but at night you might be
shopping online, off the Internet, off
your phone.
And so, a marketer if they want their
brand to be the brand that's chosen, has
to
understand this complex decision making
process that operates,
in 24/7, all the time, all day, every day.
365 days of the year.
In the rest of the session, what we'll do
is
go through each of these different stages
that I identified.
And understand what the decision making
process is at each of these stages.
If you're a brand and you want to be
purchased, you've got to
make sure your brand is being considered
in each one of these stages.
If your brand falls out of consideration
in an
earlier stage and never makes it to the
purchase
stage, you then have a better idea of what
you should do to get your brand to be
considered.
So it's very important to understand this
decision making process
and understand the strength of your brand
at each stage.
