Right, so the first thing we want to think
about in
terms of customers is what is it that
drives price sensitivity?
This fundamental thing that dictates How
high or how
low somebody's willingness to pay is for
the product.
So I'm going to go through some of the
most common things that dictate price
sensitivity, and I'll leave you as an
exercise to think about a couple of
others.
The first thing that really drives price
sensitivity is ease of product comparison.
So if I have one
product, product A, let's say made by a
manufacturer,
Johnson & Johnson, And right next to it on
the shelf, I have another product that's
made by
the retailer, a private brand, as Barbara
talked about.
If they're really easy to compare and I
can turn the products over and see that
they're
essentially the same thing, then I might
be willing
to buy the unbranded or the private
labeled product.
So, when comparison is made easy, consumer
price sensitivity typically goes up.
So as a seller or as a firm as an
entrepreneur usually what
you want to do is you want to make price
comparison against your alternative
and the competitor alternative somewhat
difficult for
the customer you want to focus them
on other things like the quality of your
product, your service and so on.
The second thing that's very very
important in terms of driving
price sensitivity is the amount of overall
expenditure that's being done.
So if I'm going out and I'm buying
new tires for my car and the tire's $500
versus $600 I might
be like man I think I have to get those
$500 tires, 100 bucks is a lotta money.
But if I'm buying a car for $20,000 and
the dealer
Amy says to me, you know, you can have
these fancy
tires for 600 or like the rubbish tires
for 500 I'm
like well its only another 100 bucks on
20,000 its nothing.
So, when we're thinking about
things in percentage terms or as a small
piece of an overall
expenditure our price sensitivity also
goes
down so what's the implication for you
the seller, you want to try and get the
buyer to think
about what they're buying is really a
small piece of the overall picture.
The other thing, of course, that's related
to this, is
if there's a separation between the buyer
and the payer.
So maybe I shouldn't say this on a public
video, but I've already
started down the path, so let me do it
anyway.
So I try to save the school money when I
fly from Philadelphia to San Fransisco,
usually buying a coach class ticket and
then
trying to upgrade into first class if I'm
lucky.
But sometimes, I might actually pay, or,
not pay, I might actually
buy a first-class ticket, but of course
I'm being reimbursed for that.
So I'm less price sensitive because it's
not coming directly from
my pocket, but it's coming from the pocket
of the institution.
The other thing that's very, very
interesting in price sensitivity
is when there's a separation in time or
method of payment.
So, in an earlier video we spoke about the
matching of supply and demand.
And the example I gave you was Uber which
is a car service where
you can take your mobile phone and you can
order a car to come and
pick you up and then the car the driver,
let's say Chris, takes you
wherever you want to go you get out of the
car no money changes hands.
Simply what happens is you get a text
message or, on the app, you get the bill.
So in that case, I don't really feel the
pain of payment, the pain of payment.
If I had to take $20 out of my wallet
every time I used
Uber, I might think about walking a little
bit more often or taking the subway.
But because the payment is happening just
purely in my phone
and I'm not feeling it directly, I'm
becoming less price sensitive.
So that's another thing that makes price
sensitivity lessened.
A couple of other things that are
interesting here when
there's a price quality inference I become
less price sensitive.
So if I needed to hire a lawyer for
example,
if I were in some kind of trouble with the
immigration
service do I want a Amy's cheap lawyer's
$50 an
hour or do I want Chris's expertise
lawyers $500 an hour.
In that case, where there's an inference
that the higher
price leads to a higher quality, certainly
for an important
service, then my price sensitivity is
again lessened.
So hopefully those four things give you a
sense of how
you can have a customer psychologically
feel a little bit less price-sensitive.
Now, of course, this begs the question of
how would one measure price sensitivity?
Would you just do it intuitively or would
you try and do some research?
What I'm going to take you through now is
there are really four ways to figure out
price sensitivity.
I'm going to show on the screen a two
by two matrix that explains these four
different ways.
You could measure people in their natural
environment.
Buying, buying things or doing filling in
survey's that's the
first column or you could run an
experiment sort of an
unnatural environment but it's control
either in the field or the
lab or you could engage in something
called trade off analysis.
Those are the two columns of this matrix.
And then on the rows, you can either
measure actual
purchase behavior or you could measure
their preferences and intentions.
So here's an example of an experiment.
This was actually done by a colleague of
mine
at the Wharton School Steve Hoch, who's a
professor here.
And he wanted to try and understand, for
supermarket retailers,
whether or not they could raise prices or
lower prices.
So what they did is they cooperated with a
institution
in Chicago, those of you who are in
Chicago called
Dominick's Finer Foods, it's a supermarket
chain located in the Chicago area.
And what they did was in some of the
stores
all of the prices were systematically
lowered by about 9%.
On a bunch of different products, like
detergents, paper towels, canned tuna, and
so on.
In another group of stores, the prices
were just kept as is, and
in a third group of stores, all the prices
on those same goods
were increased by 9%.
So that's a classic experiment where we
have a control group, we manipulate
some things downwards, Some things
upwards,
and then we look at what happened.
And what they found was very, very
interesting.
They found that when prices were raised,
demand
went down by a little bit, as you can
see in the light gray there on the chart,
but actually, the drop in demand wasn't
that much.
Customers hadn't really noticed these
pretty small price changes,
order of magnitude 9%.
So profits went up quite a bit.
So this experiment would indicate that
those multi product
retailers could probably increase their
price a little bit.
And you can probably think of some
psychological
reasons why that works in a grocery
environment like
it's not really efficient for me to pay
attention
to every single price and try and remember
it.
Now of course, this study was done in the
1990s, might be a different thing if
they did it today in 2013, because, again,
I could take
out my friendly iPhone and have my entire
grocery list on here.
Or I could use an app like the Save On app
or the SnipSnap Coupon App, and from those
apps, I would be able to remember the
prices,
or at least my device would do it for me.
Okay, second way that we could measure
price, and this is a method that
was really developed by one of our former
colleagues here at the Wharton School
Professor Paul Green.
Paul was a very, very influential fellow
in the area of marketing, and he
was one of the founders of what's
being known as conjoint analysis or
tradeoff analysis.
So in a conjoint analysis you present
people different kinds of stimuli and what
you do is you manipulate certain things,
so I'll give a personal example on this.
When the four students who founded or
former students who founded the company
Warbyparker.com
selling glasses and eyeware on the
internet.
We did a project together here at the
Wharton school to try
to understand gee what the heck should we
charge for these glasses?
What should be the price?
Now we knew of course we didn't want to
price purely from the cost and do cost
plus pricing we wanted to figure out from
the
top down the customer willingness to pay
the ceiling.
So what we did was we presented
different groups of people, glasses and we
manipulated
just one feature of the glasses.
So Amy's group would see a pair of nice
blue
Warby Parker glasses and the price would
be $75 and
then we'd ask Amy and the other people in
the
survey how willing they would be to buy
that product.
And then in a second group let's say
Chris'
group we would raise the price to $85 but
show
the same pair of glasses and see what the
response was and we did this for four
prices 75,
85, 95, and 105 and through the conjoint
analysis we noticed the following.
Demand was highest $75.
It dropped at $85.
85 to 95 was about the same.
And then once we went to $105 there was
another drop.
So, from this pretty rigorous statistical
analysis it was clear to
us that among those four prices, $95 would
be the right price.
This is something for those of you out
there who want to do conjoint analysis.
There are many very good commercial
providers and consulting firms who
can help you do this, and lot of good
publicly available information.
I'd encourage to you to learn a little bit
about conjoint analysis.
We don't have time to go into all the
details here, because it's also a
method that very useful for trying to
value
your brand, as well as just set prices.
Okay, the other two methods that sometimes
get used are just direct surveys.
Now when you ask people how much they're
willing to pay, you have to be really
careful
if you ask them directly because they'll
low
ball you and give you a really low price.
So the better way to ask that question
through a survey is indirectly.
So again I could say to my friend Amy
here's a pair of Warby Parker glasses
for $95 on a scale of one to
seven, one meaning very unlikely to buy,
seven meaning
very likely to buy, how likely would you
be to buy this product?
And maybe the group exposed to that
condition gives an average score of six.
And then I take the same survey and I take
it to Chris and a bunch of
other people and I say, how likely would
you be to buy these glasses were they
$105?
And I find that the average score from
that
group on a seven point scale is only five.
So you see the way I am getting at the
price, I am getting it indirectly
rather then directly that's the best way
to do it through a survey.
And then finally, this is not a direct
topic for our course together, but
something I
do a lot on my own research, that you can
run what's called a regression analysis.
So you could take some real sales data,
and you
could look at various prices and other
things that are affecting
sales, and you could compute that thing
we've all heard
about in economics, the price elasticity
of demand by doing some
statistical and quantitative analysis.
So those are the four ways that you can
really measure price sensitivity.
Okay, you can run an experiment, you can
run some statistical regression
analysis, you could do surveys, or you
could finally do a conjoint analysis.
All four of those methods would allow you
to get that.
So now I'd like to spend a little bit of
the time just on
psychological factors of course there are
a huge number of books written on consumer
psychology and so forth so I just want to
touch on main ideas as they relate to
pricing.
So in certain countries or cultures,
digits have particular meanings so western
cultures nines's usually indicate a
discount
or sale of something of that magnitude.
So that's why a lot of products are priced
at 3.99, 2.99, $1999
somehow it feels better then just $2000.
So nines are a special
kind of number at least in western
cultures.
The second thing that's important to know
just from a psychological point
of view, is the demand curve is not always
smooth, it doesn't
always go down if this is price on the X
axis demand
doesn't always fall as prices are
increased and it doesn't always fall
evenly.
So let me give you an example of that
simple experiment that was done in
the U.K. in some supermarkets over the
year, where the regular price of a
product,
of margarine, was about $0.83.
And at $0.83 the supermarket was selling a
couple of thousand units every every week.
When they discounted the product to $0.63,
price went down, demand went up.
Increased by quite a lot, almost 200%.
So dropping the price $0.20 led
to a 200% increase in demand.
However, when the experimenters dropped
the price just a little bit more, from 63
down to
59, then the increase relative to the 83
cent price was 406.
So that's a classic example of a
threshold,
or a nonlinear response to a price
reduction.
Just by taking off another $0.04 or a
small percentage you almost doubled the
lift
that you got.
