So, welcome back, everybody.
We're continuing with go-to-market
strategies.
And this time we're going to talk about
customer
access and distribution, so the fourth P,
Place Distribution.
So, let me just run through how we are
going to address place, as we go through.
There's just really going to be two key
things.
The first thing is, how do channels
of distribution develop the structure that
they do?
So, who's doing what?
Whose giving the product to the end
consumer?
And then secondly,
how do channels get coordinated?
Because channels of distribution are often
places for conflict.
So for example, I'm Procter and Gamble.
I'd love it if all Wal-Mart did was only
sell Tide.
But of course, Wal-Mart wants to have a
lot of variety on the shelf.
Why is that?
Because not everyone wants to buy Tide.
People want choice.
And so oftentimes in a channel of
distribution there is inherent conflict.
So we're going to look at, the structure
of channels, and also how channels get
coordinated.
So let me begin with some interesting
things I think about distribution or
place.
We call place sometimes the final
frontier, the final P.
Oftentimes people don't think about
distribution as a way to innovate.
But I think they really should and here's
some reasons why.
So a distribution can really be
an important source of, sustainable
competitive advantage.
So think about the kind of advantage that
a
company like Apple, has developed through
the fact that
it owns its own stores and it owns the
experience with the customer.
Secondly, distribution can provide
increasing returns to scale.
What do I mean by that?
If I'm a large brand like Coca Cola and
I'm distributed by every single outlet in
the state of Pennsylvania, I may get a
disproportionate return to market share
just because I'm everywhere.
And then the third thing to think about
is,
distribution decisions can be sort of long
lived and
difficult ones.
If you build physical distribution its
going to cost you some money to do
so so you really have to be sure about the
return you can get.
Now, as I said earlier I think
distribution is
often overlooked, but also it's a place
where there
can be tremendous value unlocked in terms
of new
business ideas, new services, an new
products, coming into play.
So think about the way that you can change
the
nature of a distribution channel by taking
a hard good and
turning it into a soft good.
Let me give you an example of that.
So when money is money, an only cash,
there are
certain things you can do with it, but
when money
becomes credit, or when money becomes
available on your mobile
phone, that really frees up the way people
can transact.
If you think about a movie, when a movie
can only be watched in a
theater, that's very different than being
able
to stream a movie onto your mobile phone.
So, anytime a good is a hard good and can
be changed into a
soft good through an innovation in
distribution
that can really change the nature of
markets.
Even what we're doing now through our
Coursera
class is kind of an example of this.
Normally the Coursera course or the
marketing course
that Barbara, Pete, and I teach together
would be
taught in a physical facility at the
Wharton
School to a limited audience in a
particular time.
Now, of course, it could be taught to a
much broader audience and we're really
happy about that and
also it could be taught anytime you guys
can
be watching these videos as many times as
you'd like.
So, the first thing we're going to do in
customer axis and distribution
is think about the structure of the
channel and who the key players are.
And the most basic thing to think about
here is,
whether a channel is direct, meaning that
the provider of the
good or service is going straight to the
end user,
or whether or not there are some
intermediaries or layers involved.
And let's look at this example on the
slide of the American Hospital Supply
Company to
kind of illustrate why sometimes it can be
efficient to place an intermediary between
the producer
of a good or service and the end user.
So let's imagine, we have a market with
three manufacturers
on the left hand side the three squares
and three consumers
indicated by the three circles, now if
every manufacturer had
to sell individually to every consumer,
that would be a possibility
of three by three or nine different
combinations of buying and selling
or transacting occuring, as Barbara spoke
about in the very first sessions.
On the other side, imagine how the
distributor,
or a middle person, comes into this
market.
There are still three manufacturers and
three consumers.
But now the three manufacturers just sell
their product to the
distributor, and the three consumers just
visit the distributor or the retailer.
So now there are only six possible
interactions.
So by adding a distributor to a channel,
creating
an indirect channel, I dramatically
reduced the number of
transactions, well probably not
dramatically in this example, but
if you look below the line, it's certainly
dramatic.
So, American Hospital Supply found that it
could reduce the total number of
transactions
that would be needed in this market from
850 million by aggregating down to
only about 100,000.
That's still a lot, but it's a huge
reduction.
So that's the economic theory of why
an indirect channel is sometimes preferred
over
a direct channel because it reduces the
total number of transactions that are
required.
So again, there are some efficiency
advantages of
having an indirect channel over a direct
channel.
However, there other advantages to going
direct.
What might some of those reasons be?
Well, if I go to direct to the end to the
end customer,
I might create a special barrier to entry
to others in that market.
So, now, for example that Apple as a
manufacturer goes
direct to a attain customers through its
retail store, makes it
difficult for other sellers of how where
and related software's
do the same thing or to do it just as
well.
A another reason for going direct, is you
get sometimes much
better feedback from the market, if when
you have to rely
on some into media read to tell you what
customers
really like what variety and what prices
then maybe I'm
willing to do so, so by going direct you
can
kind of go around or cut out the middle
man.
The third thing that you can do is you
can sometimes bundle other goods or
services more efficiently.
Higher margin products.
So if I go into the Apple store to buy an
iPhone, maybe they
can also sell me a laptop and some other
devices while I'm in there.
Because now, the manufacture
is controlling that channel, and going
direct to the end consumer.
So what I'm showing here now is a diagram
that kind of explains
in graphical form all of the things that
happen in a channel of distribution.
All of the various flows that have to take
place and this
is a pretty long channel of distribution
as you can see going
all away from the supplier of the good and
service on one
side, all the way to the end customer on
the other side.
So here are the five things
that have to happen.
And this is an interesting diagram because
it also
helps you understand how this flow can be
disrupted.
So first of all, physical product has to
move from
the supplier all the way down to the end
user.
Secondly, sometimes there's a flow of
title of ownership.
Of course, there's a flow of payment some
how the
end user has to send the payment back, to
the supplier.
And then, of course,
there is information and promotional flows
as well.
So, what I want us to think about here is
in the channel of
distribution, there are players who are
responsible
for the flow of both goods and
information.
So as you look at this chart, I encourage
in your own time to think about how the
channel
of distribution could be disrupted in a
way that's
very, very innovative that might lead to a
new business.
So let's look at the one at the top
which is the physical flow of good and
services and
let's relate that back to our course case,
quidsi.com.
So how did Quidsi change or disrupt this
existing channel of distribution?
Well, in the pre Quidsi days, if I wanted
to buy some detergent, I had to go to a
supermarket, who'd received that product
from a manufacturer, via warehouses
and distributors, pick it up myself and
take it home.
What Quidsi did is innovating on the
delivery
to end customers by sending that product
via
Federal Express or UPS directly to my
home.
We're seeing, of course, increased
innovation in
this area too as companies like Ebay,
Google,
Amazon and so on are figuring out ways to
either send things directly to our
home of their physical goods and services
or perhaps send them to intermediary
places, like
existing stores where there are lock boxes
and we can then go and pick them up.
The same thing also applies for services
not just for physical products.
Think about the process whereby in the old
days you might want to
book a hotel if you were going to New York
City for a vacation.
You might have to call a travel agency or
even go to the
hotel website and find out if the product
is available or call somebody.
Now of course, that's been disrupted by
apps; such as, Hotel Tonight.
You can just go onto an app, you can see
all of
the hotels in New York City, where you can
stay for one night,
at whatever the rate is for a single
night,
and you can just book directly on your
mobile phone.
So again, this is a very, very interesting
chart, because
i'm sure if you go through, you can think
of
ways that this system can be disrupted
either for information
or for physical good or for title and so
on.
One other example I think is an old one
but very very instructive if you go back
to what Michael Dell did, way back in
the 1990's, he realized that there was a
physical
flow of computers where the manufacturers
like Hewlett Packard and IBM and so on,
sold into distributors, and the product
eventually
ended up on a shelf in computer stores.
But Chris, my friend and I, would go
shopping and we would talk
to a salesperson Amy, who would tell us
what we needed, and so on.
So very long complicated channel,
involving
people handling inventory and everything
else.
At a certain point, Michael Dell realized,
well, people know enough about computers
now to order them directly on their own,
they can call
1-800-DELL, we could make it and customize
it and ship it directly.
So I can't really stress enough a that
distribution is a
tremendous source of advantage of new
business ideas and also of leverage.
I'll just give one more example just so
you can think about this in simple terms.
To compliment the previous chart, think
about distribution channels as providing
flows for physical things and for
information things.
So, what do I mean by this?
So, the distribution channel might be
required to establish an assortment,
might be required to deliver things, to do
installation and repair.
Those are all physical things that need to
be done.
The distribution channel also needs to
provide information, so understand
what customers want, generate leads,
procure market feedback, an so forth.
So, almost everything
that's done in a distribution channels, is
some combination
of a physical flow, an also, an
information flow.
So now what I'd like to do is to share
with you a very useful tool or a very
useful framework for understanding how a
distribution channel actually functions
in terms of the activities that need to be
done.
It's called a hybrid grid.
A hybrid grid is just simply a matrix.
I know you learned a lot about various
matrices from Pete.
This is the same idea
in a different context.
So, the columns of our matrix are going to
be
the activities that need to be performed,
everything from generating
initial leads, all the way through to the
sale of
the product or servers and then
potentially even after sale.
The rows are going to be the individuals
or
entities who will be responsible for
performing these various tasks.
And the idea is, you want to construct
a system of distribution that's optimized
for the customers
that you're trying to reach.
You want the exact right person to be
performing the
exact right customer such as the channel
operates efficiently and smoothly.
The example I'm going to give is an
interesting product,
it's actually a business-to-business
product sold to farmers that's called BGH.
It's a bovine growth hormone.
I'm not suggesting that you should buy any
of this, but I'm going
to show you how it works in terms of the
hybrid bridge hybrid grid.
So, the marketing
challenges for the company, Monsanto, who
produced this product for multiple.
In particular they had four things they
really had to worry about.
So how could they educate farmers that
this was
a good thing to use on their, their herd?
How could they assure quality?
How could they make sure that the farmers
were using it correctly?
And then also, how could they recycle and
take care of used syringes and so on?
So the question was, who on Earth is going
to do what?
So now let me show you
this by way of a chart, again you can see
from the left to
the right in the columns are all of the
activities that need to be performed.
Everything from generating awareness all
the way through to monitoring that the
vets and the farmers, sorry that
the farmers are using the product
appropriately.
On the column, sorry, on the rows we see
all the entities or individuals who're
responsible for various activities.
And where I blued in
the square the idea is, this is the
optimal combination of activity in person
who's performing it.
And the way you figure out the optimal
combinations to figure out two things.
First of all, who's best at doing this,
from a customer point of view,
and secondly, who is going to get the
compensation or the rewards for doing so?
So, if we start for example, with
generating awareness and
interest that is a task that was going to
fall
to the agency.
A outbound telemarketing and also Monsanto
sales people,
that's not something that local vets are
probably
going to be motivated to do unless their
going to be somehow compensated for doing
that.
So the idea is, its the person or entity
that's best at doing it and also the
person
or entity who's going to receive the
benefit from
actually undertaking the effort to engage
in that activity.
So again, if you wanted to apply this,
I would encourage you to take your
existing business, or business idea,
if you're an entrepreneur, and try to
figure out what needs to
be done, activities, and then who should
actually be doing these activities
from the point of view of optimizing the
design of the channel.
