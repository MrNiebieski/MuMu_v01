Welcome everybody.
It's David Bell here from the Wharton
School.
I'm the Xinmei Zhang and Yongee Dai
professor.
I haven't seen you for awhile.
By now you would have been spending time
with my colleagues, Barbara and Pete.
Barbara will take you through branding.
Pete will have talked a lot about
customers,
and what I'm going to talk about is
execution.
Where the rubber really meets the road.
So we're going to talk specifically about
how to acquire
some of those customers that Pete was
talking about.
We're going to talk about the interaction
between
the online world, which is increasingly
prevalent.
E-commerce and the offline world.
And then finally some tactical things
about
advertising, search engine optimization,
pricing, and all
those good things that we need to do to
really interact and acquire our customers.
I also want to explain where we are.
We're somewhere quite interesting and
different today.
We're at the site of Quincey in Western
Pennsylvania.
Quincey means what if, in latin.
And the idea really comes from a former
student of
ours Mark Lore and his friend, childhood
friend
[INAUDIBLE]
who founded a company way back in 2005
called 1-800-Diapers.com.
So for those of you out there who may have
what you make think is a crazy idea.
Be encouraged, don't be discouraged
because the crazy idea of Mark and
[INAUDIBLE]
Was to sell baby products and diapers over
the internet.
it is now 2013 of course, I'm standing in
a warehouse that's 1,200,000 square
feet large, carries over 200,000 unique
products, and is selling those products
throughout the entire continental U.S., to
literally hundreds of thousands of
households, and
this was an idea that started only, about
seven or eight years ago.
So, it's really incredible to think of the
traction that
it's taken, and all of that traction has
really to do with execution.
So, you can have a great idea.
You can have a great brand.
You can think you know who the target
customer is, but
to really get things off the ground, you
have to execute.
And that's what we're going to be focusing
on here.
