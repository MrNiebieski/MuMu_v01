So now, just to recap, we've done two
studies that I think
show some very, very interesting findings
about spreading contagion and influential
users.
We've looked at demand for netgrocer.com
spreading through neighborhoods throughout
the United States.
We've also looked at who's influential for
whom in social networking sites.
So we've been in the real world, and in
the virtual world.
Now let's flip back to the real world
again.
So one area that gets looked at a lot for
influence and
contagion is among professionals,
particularly professionals
who are in the medical community.
So what I'm showing you here is a diagram
that's
coming from a paper that was written by
two of
my colleagues here at the Wharton School
and also one
of their colleagues out of the University
of Southern California.
This is a network.
You might recognize this kind of diagram
from the very first thing
that we looked at when we
started this discussion about networks and
neighborhoods.
That YouTube link that I gave you
to show the spreading of obesity, that
controversial
study, throughout Boston and the United
States.
This is the same thing here.
What this is showing is among 174
physicians in the Los Angeles area who is
connected to whom and the size of
the circles also indicating some degree of
influence.
So what the firm, the medical firm and the
researchers wanted
to understand, is who in this network is
influential for whom?
And by how much?
So again to go back to my all purpose
friend Chris, who's now going to wear the
hat of a doctor.
If Chris is a physician in L.A. and I'm
also a physician, if he starts prescribing
a certain drug to his patients, maybe I'm
going to follow along and do the same
thing.
Now of course if the drug company knows
which
doctors are influential that's very
important for targeting purposes.
So what the colleagues did is they used
the
methodology very, very similar to what I
showed you earlier.
Remember we had the four zip codes, Z1,
Z2, Z3,
Z4.
In this case it's the same idea but
instead of zip codes they're doctors.
So they looked at which doctors were
connected to whom.
That's the first piece of information.
And then secondly, which doctors had
already prescribed the
drug, and which doctors had yet to do so.
So, remember when we study contagion
processes we need to know two things.
Who's connected to whom and who's done
what up until the current point in time.
Now, they found a couple of really
interesting things.
Let me give
you the highlights.
They measured influence and contagion in
two very different ways.
One way was to just ask people on a self
reported
basis, hey are you influential on a scale
of 1 to 10.
And, it turns out, if people say they're
influential it's not too bad, but
it's actually a relatively weak predictor
compared
to an indirect measure of measuring
influence.
Which is whether or not I'm citing Chris's
work as a doctor.
I'm referring to his scientific studies.
So, instead of looking at a measure of
influence that is self reported, what they
did is they had another measure of
influence that was in some sense more
objective.
Were doctors referring to each other's
work and each other's scientific studies?
And they found the second one was more
important
in predicting the way these drugs were
going to diffuse.
So now let me give you the main takeaways
from
this study which I think was really,
really fascinating doctors.
So first of all, the firm found it was
really helpful for them to try and
understand the
network structure of their customers, in
this case the doctors.
And also, in understanding this network
structure, they were
able to identify that a contagion process
was at work.
And the contagion process was driven by
these influential people.
Now whats really interesting about this is
some of the interest, the influential
people
weren't necessarily the people who put
their
hands up, and said hey I'm influential,
but they were the people that they figured
out indirectly were influential.
That is, the doctors who, to whom others
referred
in terms of scientific studies and
citations and so on.
And there are also some quite special
people who
had their feet in different camps as it
were.
So, in the study they found there
were certain Asian-American doctors who
both were influential
for other Asian Americans but also for
people outside of that ethnic group as
well.
So very very interesting.
It tells us that understanding the network
structure is important.
Number two, that contagion occurs through
the network, and
number three, in all networks, there are
certain special people
who are more influential than others, and
our job
as marketers is to try and understand who
those are.
So now, let's turn to our fourth and final
study, so
we've just finished the study of
physicians in the real world.
We've looked at some other things in the
virtual world.
And now, we're going to back to the
virtual
world again, but with a real world twist.
The company that we looked at, in this
case, is a company called Bonobos.
It's been around since about 2007, selling
men's clothing online.
also selling through traditional
retailers, and I think I mentioned
them a little bit earlier in the piece as
well.
So this resulted in a paper that my
colleague and friend Jay Young
Lee and I wrote about something
called neighborhood social capital and
online sales.
So let's look in and see what that's
talking about.
So now I'm just showing you a screenshot
of the
company, Bonobos, so you can see that
they're selling to
men, the target is males aged roughly 20
to 45
who are somewhat fashion-forward and
looking for affordable, fashionable
clothing.
So, what we wanted to do in this case was
we wanted to try and understand whether
or not there was real world interaction
that
was increasing the virtual world sales of
this company.
So what
I mean by that is that my friend Chris and
I, so Chris is back
in the picture, this time he's just a
regular friend who wants a pair of pants.
He's not a doctor anymore.
so Chris and I are friends.
And if Chris happens to buy some items of
clothing
from Bonobos.com and I see him wearing
them, and he
tells me about them, is that going to lead
me to
then increase the chance that I buy from
the same website?
That's what we wanted to look at.
Whether or not, interaction in the real
world was going to lead to
additional sales in the virtual world, or
at the website of the company.
That was the first piece.
Now the second piece, again here it's on a
slide, we wanted to
see whether or not there was an effect of
something called social capital.
Social capital is a really fascination
concept, and
it's one that was really coined, I
believe, by
a fellow at the Harvard University's
Kennedy School of
Government, a gentleman by the name of
Robert Putnam.
He wrote a book called Bowling Alone.
You know, you think of bowling temp and
bowling in America, the metaphor is
Bowling Alone.
That we're people us, maybe somewhat less
social than they used to be.
Maybe we're spending all of our
time online, we're disconnected from other
people.
And, so what he wanted to do is he wanted
to understand, in local neighborhoods, how
connected people were to others.
Did they participates in churches and
tennis clubs
and get together with each other and so
on.
And what he did is he did a
huge survey called the Social Capital
Community Benchmark Survey.
Where he and his team literally went
around to about 30,000 different ZIP
codes within the United States, and they
asked people like my friend, Chris.
Hey, Chris, do you like your neighbors?
Do you trust your neighbors?
Do you interact with your neighbors?
And so some very interesting data was
collected about trust and interaction.
So neighborhoods with more trust and
interaction
are neighborhoods that have higher social
capital.
We wanted to see whether in neighborhoods
with more social
capital, there would be more sharing, more
efficient sharing of information.
Now I just want to draw your attention
to one other thing about this particular
website.
There are three conditions related to the
product that are particularly important
for our study.
The first is, that items of clothing, like
the
sweater that I'm wearing, have what are
called non-digital attributes.
What does that mean?
Well a non digital attribute is something
that's
very hard to represent perfectly over the
internet.
So price is a digital attribute.
If I go to Amazon and I see a book as
costing $20, I know it's $20.
It's easy to communicate price information
over the Internet just
as it would be if it were positioned in a
store.
However, to try and communicate how this
fits and feels is actually quite
difficult.
So in that case, transmission of
information
from one customer to another in the
real off-line environment could be very,
very important.
Secondly, in our study, we wanted to focus
on
those customers who hadn't yet bought
anything from the website.
This was going to be their first-time
purchase.
Why is that?
Well, because once you've bought something
from a web-site and
you've tried on the sweater, you have your
own judgment.
You don't necessarily need the opinion of
other people, unless it's about the
overall fashionability.
And then finally this is a product that's
socially visible.
So, it might be one
that actually generates a conversation.
So, I might see Chris, and say, hey Chris,
you
look very well dressed today, where'd you
get those pants?
And then a conversation ensues.
So, I just wanted to reiterate that this
is
a product category that's a little bit
different to
most of the products that we've been
talking about
that are being sold by our friends at
Quidsi.
Places like Soap.com and Diapers.com.
Those products have primarily digital
attributes, there's no
real surprise if you order some Tide
detergent and
it shows up at your house, you know
exactly what you're going to get.
There's no problem of communicating that
through the Internet.
So this time we wanted to look at a
business that was a
little bit different, that was a fashion
business that had these other properties.
So let me show you what the raw data look
like.
These are just the sales data for the
company over the first,
I think, 42 months or three and a half
years of operations.
You can see that over time the number of
new customers coming in is going up.
You can also see with the blue arrows that
in neighborhoods where there's more trust
and interaction the sales
are higher than in neighborhoods where
there's less trust and interaction.
So what do this all mean?
Well Jay and I put together a statistical
model to try and understand this in more
detail.
And what do we find?
And the findings are here shown on the
screen but let me explain what's going on
here.
We found that of about the 6000 trials
that we look at,
at least half of them were influenced by
what we call social learning.
Meaning the evidence from the statistical
analysis suggested that some of these new
customers became customers because someone
in their
local neighborhood told, told them about
it.
So that's a pretty important effect, half
or all sales of this company.
Secondly, and related to that we found the
customers who came later
on were the ones that were most influenced
by the social interaction.
This ties back to some of the themes that
we've talked about earlier.
The people who do things right in the
beginning,
they don't usually need to rely so much on
the opinions of others.
They just like to go out and do stuff.
The people who come in later, they require
more social
information typically, and that was also
confirmed in our study.
The second thing that we found that was
really, I
think, the most interesting finding to us
was the following.
In neighborhoods where there's more trust
and interaction, more social capital,
there's not
necessarily higher sales, so it's not
that just neighborhoods with trust and
interaction
have people who buy more stuff.
But what happens is in those neighborhoods
when information gets transmitted,
it's more believable and it's more
trustworthy and it's more efficient.
So if Chris and I live in a neighborhood
where we trust each other
and like each other, if he tells me
something, I put more weight on it.
That's the result that was coming through
here.
So, how could the firm, Bonobos.com, or
any firm kind of use this information?
Well, when we did our analysis,
we were a little bit restricted to only
the zip
codes where the social capital survey
measures had been collected.
So there are many many zip codes in the
United States for which those measures
were not collected.
Now, earlier, I think I said that Mr.
Putnam went out and he measured 30,000 zip
codes,
actually, just to be clear, he measured
30,000
people who were living in about 1000 zip
codes.
So if a firm really wanted to use this,
clearly only knowing about 1000 zip codes
is not quite enough.
So here's a question that I want to put to
you
all out there, and then I'll, I'll give
you the answer.
If you could think of a proxy, that means
some other
variable, other than the true measure of
social capital, that would
indicate that males aged roughly 20 to 45
were socializing together
and had some level of social capital, what
might it be?
The number of hospitals per zip code.
Number of churches, maybe?
Number of Rugby clubs, okay you're going
in the right direction.
Turned out, that the number of bars and
liquor stores per capita, was
a very nice predictor of the efficient
diffusion of information among this group.
Why am I telling you this?
Because, I want you to be creative and to
think a little bit expansively when you
start to use
these concepts and you start to think
about, gee,
how could I use this idea for my own
business
that I'm working on or the company that
I'm working at now?
So that brings the conclusion to this
piece of our discussion.
I hope you enjoyed those four studies.
Number one, the netgrocer.com, number two,
the social networking site of Influence.
Number three, looking at the fusion of
drug prescribing behavior by physicians,
and finally,
how offline interaction is affecting
people sales
sales of products on the internet for
bonobos.com.
