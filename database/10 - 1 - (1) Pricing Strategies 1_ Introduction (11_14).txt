So today we're going to talk about pricing
devalue as part of our go-to-market
strategy.
So let me just give you a little bit of an
overview of where we're going to go.
I'm going to start out by giving you some
pricing puzzles, and some cute things that
go on pricing.
Then we'll talk about a framework for how
to understand, how to set a price.
And then we'll spend a little bit of time
on customer
price sensitivity and how to measure it
and how to understand it.
That's going to be our road map for these
next few sessions.
Let's begin with some motivations and some
puzzles.
And before I say this, pricing is probably
one of the key things to
really think about in marketing because
often
times prices are made really really
arbitrarily.
So I see that competitor one is charging
40 US dollars competitor two is
charging 20 and so I just choose 30, no
really rhyme or reason to it.
Or people engage in cost plus pricing,
many things that they shouldn't be doing,
and what we want to do in this session is
to think about the right way to set a
price.
So let's begin.
Here's a little bit of motivation for you
from a study that was done by the McKinsey
Company that looked at various things that
firms could
do, over 2,000 companies, to improve their
operating profits.
They could improve their fixed cost
position, they
could improve their variable costs and so
on.
But the thing that they did that had the
most impact, if they were able
to improve their final realize price by
only 1%, they
were able to increase their profit
operating profit by about 11%.
So price is such a critical level, and
it's one that we
often get wrong, so let's keep that in
mind as we go through.
Here are some puzzles just to give a sense
of
all of the interesting things that go on
in pricing.
The first one is for a company called
Trader Joe's.
It's a company that sells a lot of private
label product.
I believe it's owned by some German
brothers, operates in the
United States all over the country,
there's one here in Philadelphia.
Now as Barbara told you in branding,
there are both national brands and private
labels.
Most of what Trader Joe's sells are
private label products.
So one of the products that I like there
is they sell goza a
dumplings that I can buy and I can steam
and I can eat them.
Now let's imagine that those
dumplings cost me about $3.99.
Now that's all well and good because I
like the dumplings, but somehow I start
scratching
my head and I say, gee you know, is $3.99
really a good price for those dumplings?
And I face a problem.
The problem I face is I can't find
that product anywhere else, because it's a
private label.
So I don't really know is it a good deal
or a bad deal.
If I'm paying $2 for a can of coke, I know
that's a bad deal, and I know the store's
ripping me off.
So Trader Joe's recognizes that I have
this inference problem, so what do they
do?
They take a very very common product like
bottled water that's available
everywhere and then price it at an
extremely low price all the time.
So when I come into the store and I see
that the bottled water, a product that I
can compare that's
available everywhere, I see that that's
priced very low, that
gives me some confidence that the products
I can't compare are
also fairly priced.
So this example is showing how sometimes
as companies, we want
to signal through one kind of product,
that we're a good seller.
That we offer good values.
That's an example of using a product to
signal the value for the entire product
line.
A similar example, if we think about a
company like Wal-Mart.
Why is it that you might find some Tide
detergent there for $4.73 or another
product for $2.81,
these weird kind of a endings?
So in the US at least, most prices end in
either a nine or a five,
and the idea that Walmart here is ending
their prices in fours and threes and ones
and sevens, is they're trying to send you
a message that they've squeezed out every
possible
cent that they can to deliver the best
possible value to you as an in consumer.
So that's another example of using the
product price
to send a signal.
The final one I'll share is a very
interesting study done by a friend of
mine from New Zealand who teachers at the
Sloan management school up there at MIT.
And my friend Duncan did an experiment
where he sent
out shoe catalogs to people all over the
United States.
Half the people received a catalog and a
picture
of a pair of shoes and the price was $44.
The other half of the people, this is
thousands of peopl,e received
an identical catalog except the price of
the shoes was $49.
Now economics 101 tells us that as the
price goes up
demand should go down right, but Duncan
found exactly the opposite.
More shoes were sold at $49 then at $44.
And why is that?
Because when you see $44 the way you
encode it psychologically is,
gee, that's kind of a weird price, I don't
normally see 44.
Thats like 10% more than 40.
But when you see 49, you feel like that's
a discount from 50.
And so what I'm trying to indicate through
these examples is the price
is more than just a number that indicates
what you have to pay.
It sends all kinds of other signals, and
that's
going to be one of our themes as we go
through.
So how do we set prices and what's the
right framework?
There are four inputs to pricing.
First of all we need to think about the
marginal
cost of the product I'm going to call that
the floor.
Obviously we don't want a price below the
floor or at least not for too long.
Then we need to think about the ceiling
which is the customer willingness to pay.
So number one is the floor, number two
is the ceiling, the customer willingness
to pay.
But you can't always charge people their
absolute maximum willingness to pay.
Why is that?
Because of competition.
So competition is going to be the third
factor that will drop
the possible ceiling.
If my customer is willing to pay $10 but
he can get that product from
a competitor for six, then that's going to
drop my price from ten down to six.
And then number four is the amount by
which prices have to be raised from
marginal cost to give some money to
distributors
or re-sellers to motivate them to sell it.
So those are the four key inputs to
pricing
that we're going to go through by way of
example.
I'm also going to show you a couple
of examples of something called economic
value to the customer.
This is a very, very important concept.
And first example, well the only one I'm
going to show is something that
might be useful for you, those of you who
like to eat chicken wings.
There's a product called the wing dipper.
And the wing dipper is a place where you
can put the
dip within what you want to, to dip your
chicken, chicken wings.
I guess it turns out when people eat
chicken wings, I don't eat it a lot
myself.
I guess they spray the dip
around, or they make a mess.
And so therefore the restaurants are
losing a lot of money whereas if
they had these wing dippers, the wing
dipper controls the amount and based on
the size of your restaurant and the amount
of wings that get eaten
you can calculate as a restaurant what the
economic value of this product is.
So many times in your communication you're
thinking about the economic value to
the customer and trying to say that in a
persuasive or informative way.
Okay, so now let's think about this
pricing framework
of the cost the customer willingness to
pay the amount
that collaborates sorry competitors will
bring the price down
and collaborators will bring the price up
through some examples.
Let's relate the five C's of marketing:
customers,
company, collaborators, competitors, and
context, to the pricing decision.
So first of all from a company point of
view
when your setting a price you might need
to think
about financial considerations what's my
required internal rate of return.
You certainly need to think about
consistency in the product line
so sometimes you might have a good better
and best product.
So the price that I'm going to charge for
the Toyota Camry is somehow
going to be related to the price that I'm
charging for the Toyota Corolla.
So you need to think about spacing out the
prices in a way that's consistent.
And then thirdly you need to think about
your own existing image so it may be
very very difficult for Walmart who has a
low price image to sell really really
expensive stuff.
Similarly it may be very very difficult
for Sak's 5th Avenue to
sell things very very cheaply because
that's also inconsistent with their
overall image.
So those are three things that are very
important
to think about from a company point of
view.
From a competitor point
of view there's a whole raft of things,
but here's the three most important.
The first thing you need to think about is
that
when you set your price, how will your
competitor respond?
Will your competitor respond extremely
aggressively and take
whatever your price is and cut below it?
Is the competitor going to do things that
are rational,
does the competitor have a deep pockets
and so on.
So the first thing is how aggressive is
this competitor.
The second thing you need to think about
is when
you do something in the market with your
price how is that competitor going to
respond?
Are they going to respond by improving
their advertising,
their product or their distribution, the
other 3 P's,
or are they going to respond on the basis
of
price that's the second thing you need to
think about.
And then thirdly you need to think
about your position and the competitors
position.
So if you're the market leader, in some
sense you
have a responsibility to try and keep your
prices high.
If you're a follower you might have a
different kind of strategy.
So those are three important things with
respect to competitors
that dictate what you want to do with your
pricing.
When it comes to collaborators,
collaborators or distributors,
they care a lot about margin, but they
also
care about their return on assets, and
we'll
be talking about that a little bit later
on.
So are you pricing in such a way that
allows the collaborator
or distributor who's selling your product
to turn the product frequently enough?
And finally we come to the customer.
The customer issues are probably the most
important.
So this is where I'm going to spend the
most
time, and the key idea is customer price
sensitivity.
In terms of economics, this is sometimes
referred to as a price elasticity.
You might remember this from your high
school or college education days.
In economics, price elasticity just means
the following: if I
raise the price by 1% by how much does
demand drop?
So if I raise the price of my product by
one percent and demand drops five
percent that means that the product is
highly
elastic, there's a lot of stretch to the
price.
If I raise the price one percent and
demand only drops 0.2 of
a percent, that means that the product is
very inelastic, very very little stretch.
If I have an inelastic product, I might be
able to raise price.
If I have an elastic product I might want
to drop price.
So we're
going to get into how as marketers we
actually
measure that beyond the economic concept
of price elasticity.
A second thing we're going to talk about
are psychological issues.
Now we can spend weeks on this.
We won't spend weeks on this because we
don't have all of that time.
But I want to introduce you to the most
important psychological phenomena.
The first thing is the ending of the
price.
Whether it's an odd ending or an even
ending.
I'll also talk a little bit about
something
called mental accounting.
How we think about price in our minds.
I'll give you a short summary of a very
famous psychological principal called
Prospect Theory or psychological theory.
Actually a noble prize winning theory that
has some very very interesting
implications for pricing.
And then finally another psychological
principal called the endowment effect.
