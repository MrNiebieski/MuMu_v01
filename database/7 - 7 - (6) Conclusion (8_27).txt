All right.
So, our customer centric voyage is coming
to an end.
we started out on South Street, talking
about product centricity, pivoting to
customer centricity.
We moved into a studio, to talk about the,
the upsides to customer centricity.
Where does the profitability come from?
Or, where might it come from?
If you deal carefully with acquisition,
retention, and development.
We're in my office now, here at the
Wharton School.
And,
I'm going to wrap things up.
I want to tie a ribbon around my three
weeks of our course.
Just to give you some key take-aways.
Just the, the main points that, that we
discussed.
because this customer-centricity idea is
pretty complex.
and if there's just a few things, that
you're going to remember from it.
It's going to be these five points over
here.
First, is the idea of the cracks in
product centricity.
I don't think I need to describe what
product centricity is again.
Everyone is basically born understanding
that, at least,
if they have any exposure to the business
world.
But, the cracks in product centricity is a
new, evolving idea.
And one of the points, I really want to
emphasize around it is that the...
The list of cracks in product centricity
that,
that we covered is only going to continue
growing.
The challenges for firms to come up with
the next
big thing, and try to stay steps ahead of
their competitors.
And, keep their customers in check, is
only going to become more difficult.
So, as I said at the outset, it's not
that product centricity is ever going to
go away completely.
But, there's going to be more and more
challenges to it.
And therefore, more and more reasons to
think about this idea of customer
centricity.
Next when it comes to customer centricity
itself,
I just want to be real clear on the
definition.
because, it's real easy for people to make
mistakes,
about what customer centricity means.
For one thing, it does not mean super
duper customer service.
Just because we're really nice to our
customers, doesn't necessarily make us
customer centric.
Customer centricity arises, when we're
being really
nice to the right kinds of customers.
And, it's more than being really nice to
them.
It is truly surrounding them with a
variety of products and services and
information.
Including things, that our company might
not
produce, might not make any money off of.
So, customer centricity is quite
different.
But, there's also a danger of going too
far, to the other extreme.
And in fact, I often see it, when we have
conversations, including some of the
comments in our own discussion forum.
A lot of people think that that, that
targeting
people, taking individual data, and trying
to figure out exactly,
which individual is taking on what
activity, at
what time, they think that that's customer
centricity.
And, you know what?
It's not.
In other words, customer centricity might
embrace some of that activity,
but most of the targeting that goes on,
isn't very customer centric.
In fact, it's not very good at all.
just, just because we have the data, just
because we, we know what a particular
individual's doing.
Doesn't mean, that we should be
serving up a, a particular message to that
person at a particular time.
We want to be real careful about it.
We want to be choosy about which customers
we're really focusing on.
and we don't want to go too far with it.
So, kind of intrusive marketing, that,
that, that borders on
compromising some of the customer's
privacy That's not customer centric.
So, it's finding the just right balance,
between rolling out
the red carpet for everybody, and trying
to be everybody's
best friend, all the time.
And, the final point on my, this, quick
summary
of customer intensity is don't forget
about the paradox.
Of costumer's centricity, that, that even
when
were a very, very customer centric
organization.
We're only going to be doing those
customer centric things for the select
customers.
But, for most of our customers, who are
perfectly fine, and we're glad to have
them around.
But, we're not necessarily going to treat
them the
same way.
We're not going to deliver special
products and services for them.
But we still want to have their business.
We still want to have an ongoing
relationship.
Even if it's not quite as deep, or
intense, as it is with our best customers.
So, the paradox in customer centricity
tells us, that while we
have these super duper customers, and
we're going to treat them really well.
We still care an, awful, lot about those
regular customers.
But, we care about them in a more product
centric way.
That we're
going to come up with products and
services, or give them the...
The hand-me-down products and services,
that
we developed for the really good
customers.
We want their business.
and it's really important to us to
maintain their business.
But, we're going to do it on our terms.
And, once we understand what customer
centricity is.
If we want to bring it to life, and if we
want to make more money off it, compared
to product centricity.
It's all about a celebration of customer
heterogeneity.
Again, it's not enough just to acknowledge
that our customers are different from each
other.
But, if customer centricity is going to
succeed...
It's by really, really accentuating those
differences, to
help us go after the really good
customers.
And, sort them out from the, not as good,
customers.
And, that has all kinds of implications,
for the incentive structures that we use.
For the way that we design our
organization.
For the way that we communicate with our
customers,
and our other external shareholders.
So, the celebration of heterogeneity.
Is, is key and shows up every step, along
the way.
As we try to become customer centric.
And, the other part of our celebration
of heterogeneity, as we've discussed
earlier this week.
Is the idea of taking customer
acquisition, customer retention and
customer development.
And, dealing with them in a very different
way,
than a traditional product centric company
would do so.
These are not just low-level tactics, that
we use to support the brand.
These are tactics, that are going to be on
an equal level to the brand.
We want to be very, very careful about the
kinds of customers that we go after.
We're going to be, we're willing to spend
more money
on them, because their CLV will be worth
it.
And we going to, we're going to try to
achieve a
just-right balance, when it comes
to customer retention and customer
development.
We're not necessarily going to let those
things go.
But,
maybe we'll spend just a little bit less
money on trying to keep
our existing customers around longer, and
trying to get them to do more things.
And instead, trying to find some, really,
valuable customers.
Based on what we've learned from the, the
customers that we've already had with us.
Another important theme, that I can't say
enough about...
Is that, if we're really going to do the
customer centric strategy
the right way, we really have to think in
the long term.
The idea
of investing in the right customers.
It's not something that we can do quickly,
and
it's not going to give us a very fast
payoff.
A lot of companies talk about investing in
customers.
But they don't, necessarily, mean it.
If we're investing in customers, we're,
actually, willing to
lose a little bit of money in the short
run.
Because, by doing the right things to the
right customers,
it's going to be well worth it, in the
long run.
And, and something that goes along with
this long term thinking, is the idea
of experimentation.
I've said a little bit about that already.
But, it's important to recognize that,
that we're experimenting, not only
to figure out, what's the right message to
use right now.
But, it's adaptive learning.
So, as we're running one experiment, we're
always thinking
about what's the right experiment to run,
after that.
So, long run thinking requires us to
be always testing and learning, earning
while learning.
Experimentation is really key.
And, the bottom line is to recognize that
customer
centricity is not for everyone.
There are plenty of firms that are not
customer centric.
That's not to say that they treat their
customers badly.
But, they're not obeying all the
principles, that we discussed here.
And that's fine.
There are plenty of firms that can, that
can focus more on operational excellence,
or performance superiority.
Those are very good strategies to pursue.
But, if you want to be customer centric,
you have to understand what it is.
And, you have to make a very well-informed
decision,
about whether it's the right strategy for
your firm.
And then, how and when to go after it.
So, so I'm not trying to push everyone
towards it,
I just want them to understand what it
really is.
So, that's my story about customer
centricity.
and I hope that you found it, enjoyable
and informative.
and I hope that it might impact the way
that, that many of you go to market.
And, speaking of going to market, that's
what we're going to be focusing on next.
My colleague David Bell is going to look
much
more at, at go to market, strategies and
tactics.
what channels should we be operating in?
Looking at pricing going back to some of
the four P's that Barbara first laid out.
Going in much more depth into some of
those,
those tactical issues, that companies
really need to know.
Whether they're going to be customer
centric or not.
So, I'll, I'll wrap up my customer centric
voyage with you, right now.
and wish
you the very best.
