So let's dig a little bit more into this
notion
of showrooming, which is an extreme form
of horizontal freeriding.
For better or for worse, the showrooming
is really facilitated by technology
both mobile technology and other internet
technologies even our laptops and our
desktops.
So the data I'm showing you here is data
that's going through 2011.
And it shows the fraction of consumers,
actually even increased through 2012 and
'13,
of people who have actually used their
device their mobile
device to find a better price while
shopping in the store.
Many of you may have done this yourselves.
You've been in a local store, you've been
gathering
information doing a little bit of
horizontal free writing
and then you've picked out your mobile
phone and
you've gone to Amazon or another supplier
to buy it.
So let's look at some additional data that
kind of gets under
the hood a little bit and see's what see
what happens here.
So if you are someone
who is, want to do this, who is prone to
do it, who
is looking at mobile phone information and
prices and so forth while shopping.
The good news is that some of these people
actually will buy from the website of the
store
that they're currently in but notice also
about 25%
of these individuals end up buying from
somebody else.
Amazon or a competitor.
So the question becomes for the
traditional
retailer, what can be done to push
back or fight back against this practice.
Now you'll see as we go through these
statistics that
relates back to some of our early
discussion about why omni-channel
retailing now makes sense and you need to
touch customers
both in the physical world and the virtual
world as well.
Again, here's some more data on the kinds
of product categories that are most
susceptible to showrooming.
Right at the top, there is consumer
electronics, and then
it declines a little bit through apparel
and clothing and
so on.
My own hypothesis about why consumer
electronics are at the top is this is a
product category where we like to be
fairly well informed before we make a
purchase.
So, we may want to actually interact with
a sales person but because it's a pretty
big
ticket item what ends up happening is we
may then be persuaded or we may be
inclined.
So after having figured out from the sales
person
or the physical store the best product to
buy,
to then go online and do it at a much
cheaper price.
Just simply because of the value of the
items involved.
So how could manufacturers and retailers
fight back against this practice.
One thing that's happening now is
literally the same
TV, produced by a big manufacturer like a
Sony
or a Sony or somebody else may end up
having a slightly different model name for
different suppliers.
So then it becomes more difficult
for me to compare the price and to buy
one.
Electronically as opposed to buying it in
the store where I end up shopping.
There are however some good news, there is
however some good news for retailers in
physical stores.
About how they can push back against this
practice of showrooming.
So the chart that I'm showing you now is
the purchase
intentions of individual s who are
engaging in the showrooming behavior.
Namely being in
the physical store, then taking out from
the mobile phone and looking
for information in the virtual world, and
then thinking about buying it.
So, a third of them always plan to buy the
product online.
These are kind of the hardcore horizontal
free writers.
I'm going into Chris' Hi-fi store and
learn everything I can.
And then just it buy it at the cheapest
possible online website.
However,
the other 60 odd percent actually planned
to buy it in store
but something happened that caused them to
end up buying it online instead.
So let me say a little bit more about that
opportunity represented by
the 56 or close to 60% of individuals who
say you know what.
I would have bought a product in the
store, but I ended up buying it online
instead.
So my two colleagues are Tony Moreno
at the Kellogg School of Management and,
Santiago
Gallino, there at the Tuck School
investigated this through
something they called BOPS, buy online,
pick up in store.
As a way for traditional retailers to
fight back against this phenomenon of
showrooming.
So the idea of buy online and pick up in
store is the following.
I could go to the website of a large
retailer and Tony and
Santiago looked at a large retailer
operating
both within the United States and Canada
that had about 80 or 100 stores in this
analysis.
And the retailer implemented a program
where you could buy the product online.
Then go to the store and pick it up BOPS
buy online pick up in the store.
And so what they found was the following.
You might hope actually that sales at the
websites
will then go up because now as a consumer
I can go onto the website I can see
that this coffee maker that I'm interested
in is in
stock and then I can buy it online and go
to the store on the way home and pick it
up.
So the hope was, that by offering
consumers this
option that the sales at the website would
increase.
And I should mention that the retailer in
question, I cannot disclose the name,
but the retailer in question was mainly
selling products that are for your home.
So bedding, towels, coffee makers those
kinds of things
and this is very important for the
explanation that comes
later on.
Now what Tony and Santiago found is
instead of sales at
the website going up, sales of the website
actually went down.
Doesn't sound too good, but there's a
silver lining.
They found after this BOPS was
implemented, sales in the stores went up.
So what was happening?
So imagine myself as a consumer I want
to buy a coffee machine from this
particular retailer,
I go to the website, I see that the
product is in stock and the price
is good but because it's a coffee machine
I'd still like to perhaps taste the
coffee.
Or touch the sweater or try out the
bedding so because most of what this
retailer was
selling was, were products that required
some physical
inspection by the customer to make them
feel comfortable.
What the customer's were doing were going
online
to make sure the product was there then
going into the store and actually
purchasing in the store right
then and there.
So offering that option was very valuable
and it actually lead to an overall
increase in sales of that retailer so much
so that the new acronym instead of BOPS
buy online pick up in store turning in
Santiago referred to this as ROPO.
Research Online Purchase Offline.
So again, those of you who are facing
these
kind of omni-channel problems and
horizontal free riding, showrooming
for your own business, this shows that
there's potentially
clever ways out by really understanding
what the consumers want.
They want information first, but they want
to touch and feel the product.
And if you can deliver them that package
you
can get yourself out of, some of these
traps.
Now let me just summarize what we've,
talked about in terms of
horizontal free riding, and how this can
be, eliminated.
There's essentially, three broad
strategies, that can be,
put into place in a particular market to
try
and eliminate, this problem between, Chris
and Amy,
where Chris is the high price, high
service seller.
And the customer goes to his store to get
the information.
And then goes to Amy's store to get the
lower price.
The first thing that you could do
is you could make sure that
in different territories different
products are available.
So give Chris some of the product line and
give Amy something else.
So there's not direct competition between
them, related to that you
might need to think carefully about
the appropriate label of distribution
intensity.
If a lot of horizontal free riding is
going on, you might want to
make your distribution intensity a little
bit
lower and be more exclusive or more
selective.
Meaning that local retailers have kind of
a local monopoly.
And then finally the other thing that you
could
do is you could introduce different brands
for different retailers.
So literally just call the product
different names.
So Chris' product has a slightly different
label on it than Amy's does and this again
works against the problem of direct
comparison which
is an important component of horizontal
free riding.
So now let me summarize everything that
we've been
talking about so far on this module with
respect to conflict.
Here's three rules of thumb that have
been discovered through academic research
and to just
generally what causes more conflict in a
channel of distribution or a system of
distribution.
So three things we're going to look at
first of all are the length of the
channel.
So how many players are there between the
person who provides the
product initially, or creates it, and the
person who ends up buying it.
Secondly, how much autonomy is there in
the channel.
Are all the channel members owned by the
corporate entities.
So they're all stores owned by Starbucks.
Are they mainly franchise, so McDonalds
might have franchisees.
Or are they all completely independent
agents.
And then thirdly, how much density is
there in the channel?
Is there only one retailer or distributor
in a particular market?
Are there two?
Or are there multiple?
So this is what the researchers found with
respect to these three important factors.
So generally, as the channel gets longer
and
longer, there was just more potential for
conflict.
And there's one really fundamental reason
for this.
This is a term that was developed by a
French economist many centuries ago, and
it's called double marginalization.
It's a fancy term, it's a simple idea.
It says every time you add someone between
the producer and
the end consumer, you're adding a markup
and a layer of margin.
So if you have one retailer between the
customer and the end, sorry,
between the manufacturer, and the end
user, they'll be two levels of markup.
From the manufacturer to the retailer.
And then the retailer to the customer.
If you have two intermediaries.
There will be three levels of markup.
Manufacturer to the distributor,
distributor to
the retailer, retailer to the customer.
So as you link from the channel, you're
always adding in additional mark up to
the margin and you're adding more people
so
there's more potential for conflict that's
fairly unambiguous.
Secondly, if you look at the level of
autonomy from
having completely owned distributors to
franchised distributors to completely
independent.
Again, as people become independent,
there's
more and more conflict, the conflict
increases.
So those two I think are fairly intuitive
and fairly obvious.
The last one is less so until you hear the
story.
And this is why I think it's interesting.
So the researchers who looked at this
issue
also looked at the density of the channel.
Now you have a fairly low level of
conflict if there's just one exclusive
outlet per territory.
Of course as you increase the two, the
conflict goes up because
now I'm in competition with that store in
the territory next door.
He's stealing
some of my customers, I'm stealing some of
his.
However, what the researchers noticed is
kind of interesting, is the level
of competition or conflict starts to
decrease, when density gets really, really
large.
Why is that?
Well it's because there's now an
attribution problem.
If I see my market shares going down,
and I have eight different competitors in
my local
retail, in my local area that I'm
competing against
I don't really know which one of those
guys
is taking my market share.
So paradoxically when you have more
density of retailers in
a given location, sometimes the overall
conflict can go down.
Okay, the last little task I'd like you
all to think about
as you're working through this material
and you're thinking about what it means.
Both how channels get creative in terms of
who's doing what, the hybrid
grid the other elements of design like
intensive verses exclusive verses
selective distribution and
finally this whole area of minimizing
conflict.
I think to bring it all together would be
good to have an exercise to kind of
peculate on.
What I'd like you to do is to try and
think
about a company that really innovated in
the area of distribution.
Either they took over some existing
activity, they eliminated that activity,
they turned
a hard good into a soft good,
they completely changed the way customers
procure
the product.
And in so doing, really developed an
advantage over their competitors.
So try and think about that because I
think
a lot of the really interesting
innovations that are going
to occur and markets are going to be
innovations around
the area of distribution and access to
products and services.
Particularly as I've said many times but
appears
repeating that there is about a billion of
us running around on the planet it will
be more than that soon who are carrying
computers
in their pockets.
That can have all kinds of things
distributed to us.
And things that we can also respond to.
