So now that we see how important
a brand is at creating perceptions of
quality, let's get into some
of the inner workings of a brand and talk
about the different elements of the brand.
And let's start with, how do you choose a
brand name?
but first let me define what the different
elements are.
So there's a variety of brand elements
that can be chosen.
you can use some, not use others.
and they will totally identify or enhance
the brand awareness.
And if you choose them right, they can
help
facilitate the formation of strong,
favorable and unique brand associations.
And so the things we'll talk about are the
brand name, which is the first one, the
anchor.
different brand logos, symbols brand
characters, packaging, brand slogans and
brand colors.
When you're looking at all of these brand
elements, you gotta ask a couple of
questions.
First of all, you have to make sure all
the brand elements
work together to create a unique identity
for the product and service.
So make sure that everything you've chosen
is, is of
one, one thought, one, one belief and work
together in unison.
And the second thing
to think about is if people see the brand
elements or whatever you do create for
that brand identity independent of the
product, what
would people think of just that brand
label?
And so think about those kinds of things
in general as we
discuss some of the more tactical
issues of choosing these different brand
elements.
and when we consider each of the different
ones, and I'll
go over all of them in, you know, in
various detail.
Not, some of them are more
obvious or more, you can figure them out
for yourself more easily than others.
But, when you think about all of them, you
should think about these criteria for
choosing a good one.
The first thing, when you, when you think
about choosing
different brand elements, you really want
them to be memorable.
You want people to be able to recognize it
very
easily, and you want them to remember what
they've seen.
The other thing you want to have happen
when you choose these elements is that
they're meaningful.
And they can be meaningful in two
different ways.
One, in a descriptive way, which is, how
do they describe the attributes
of the product or the benefit of the
product or the customer segment.
And the other thing that we're looking at
is
remember these, this brand label is
forming a perception.
So you also want these brand elements to
work together
to persuade the customer of something
usually of something positive.
the other thing you're thinking about
is the, how they look, you know, and
you want them to be fun, interesting,
aesthetic.
You want it to be rich visual imagery.
And you also, if you have visual and
verbal image, imagery,
you have to think about how those two
things work together.
Again, you want a congruent unified vision
here.
Another thing to think about, and this is
very important, is can you protect your
identity?
There's two ways to protect it.
One is legally.
And so many times,
if you have a good brand name, you
trademark it and
then it's against the law for people to
copy your brand name.
But there's other things that are more
subtle and
remember I told you about that perception
of similarity.
People may not be copying exactly what you
do.
But they may do something that looks
similar and they
can kind of steal your identity by just
looking similar.
And so you not only want to have legal
protection, but
you want to try to identify a brand image
and brand elements
that work together that are hard to copy.
So that you have some sustainable
competitive advantage, in
addition to the legal protection that you
may have.
When you're thinking about this brand,
remember, it's very expensive to
create a strong brand name and it's an
extremely valuable asset.
And so the other thing you want to think
about is
how adaptable is this brand name to go, to
stay modern?
times change, consumer's taste
change, competition changes, and so you
don't want a brand name that is so, is so
static that it can't adapt with changing
times,
and it's not flexible, and it's not
updateable.
And along this line, you also want a brand
name,
if you can, or a brand image, with all
these
elements that work together that you can
use them to
go on to different products, if you
introduce new products.
So I mention Coke started out
on a regular a full calorie cola drink,
and they
stretched that brand name to go to a diet
cola drink.
So you want to think of brand images that
can go, not just on your
initial product, but could perhaps go on
other
products in the future as the company
grows.
And similarly, you want a product that can
go across cultures.
Into and that's some, a brand name, I
mean, that can go across cultures.
So you don't want something that won't be
understood or
be interpreted differently or
inappropriately in other cultures.
So more and more as brands are becoming
global.
Even if you start our very locally.
When you choose your brand elements, you
should choose brand
elements that can go global, should your
business get big enough.
And each element in, in thinking about
this brand image,
are going to play a different role in
creating those overall perceptions.
They all have different strengths and
weaknesses.
but you really want to think about how you
can use
them strategically, to achieve some kind
of balance and overall impact.
And again, as I mentioned before, they
have to
work together to, to form a unique,
consistent image.
So let's look at some of the different
brand elements and just think
about, on the face of it, what some of the
advantage and disadvantages are.
We start out, the name is obviously
crucial.
It's the
anchor and it's very, very important that
you can choose a, a, a good brand name.
Sometimes you're, there's legacy brand
names and you have
a great deal of awareness with a
particular brand name.
And maybe it wasn't the best one to
choose, but you
have to use some of the other ones to
build it up.
Like, for example, the brand name Aflac,
or Geico,
both of those are brand names that were
acronyms.
They actually weren't such great brand
names because they don't have the
advantage of a good
brand name of being quick, easy to
process, easy to remember.
And in both of those cases the marketers
us
other elements to, to, to help with the
brand names.
So Aflac came up with the, with the duck
image and Geico came up with the Gecko
image.
So that you can kind of remember those
brand names better.
But if you can choose it in the beginning,
it's better to choose one that's easy to
process and recall.
Because, the disadvantage of a brand name,
is once you bring up that or develop that
brand awareness and people really
understand what it
is, it's pretty difficult and expensive to
change.
It's not impossible.
But a lot of the whole brand imagery is
really anchored on the name.
So the name, and I'm going to spend some
time
thinking about that going forward, is
extremely important to think about.
Once you have
a brand name, then you can start thinking
about
logos and symbols, like the Nike Swoosh or
McDonald's arches.
These are attention getting.
They can be emotional.
They can reinforce any of your brand
identity.
But again, symbols and logos can get out
of date.
they, they can be ambiguous.
They can be in, interpreted differently
across cultures,
so you again, just have to think about
how those work.
Not all brands have a character, but a
character, if
you do have one, can be very quick, very
attention getting.
Think about what happens if you see Mickey
Mouse on something.
I mean that's a world famous character,
recognized every
where and people understand it's fun, it's
kids, it's exciting.
and so characters can work very well, but
they can get
outdated, or they can be culturally bound,
and certainly not all brands
have a character.
A slogan and a jingle, if it's done well,
gives you a few more words and can give
you music to add to the brand element, so
it can be used to convey meaning.
Nike's Just Do It is an extremely strong
slogan, that adds to the Nike brand name.
but again, sometimes it's difficult to
translate.
Sometimes if you do jingles, musical
tastes are different, and
not everybody likes it.
Some people think mus, some of these
jingles are annoying.
So, there's advantages and disadvantages.
Packaging also is extremely advantageous
and I'm going to show you
some examples of brands that were built on
their package design.
and we go back to this notion of
perceptions.
There's a lot of research that shows, and
I'm going to talk about
that, that people form perceptions of the
quality of the product, not by
the product itself, but by the package
it's in.
So this has a very very strong effect on
creating perceptions.
The difficulty with packaging is many
times you
don't control how it ultimately reaches
the consumer.
So the manufacturer builds a product in a
package, but then it's
the channel or the retailer that delivers
that package to the consumer.
So for example, if you want the package
oriented in
a certain way, like front on, it may not
appear
that way on the shelf.
Or if it's supposed to be refrigerated, it
may not be at the right temperature,
etcetera.
So the problem with packaging is that,
these channel issues.
But after all of these elements have
advantages and disadvantages.
If you choose them strategically, they can
work
very well to create a very strong brand
image.
Let's look specifically at this notion of
brand names.
Now, the brand name is extremely important
for many, many audiences.
Obviously, and what we've
been focusing on here, it matters to
consumers and customers.
And, it can, as I mentioned
before, seriously affect the likelihood of
purchase.
It also effects people who work for you,
for employees.
So, that you really want to do branding
externally to your market.
But internally to your employee base too.
People can be very proud of the company
they work for.
and the reputation and brand name of the
brand may make it easier or
harder to hire people, to retain people,
and may affect their morale and
productivity.
it also, the brand name, affects growth
opportunities, like I mentioned.
If the brand name is not adaptable and not
transferable, it may be difficult
for the firm to go into new markets or to
go into different products.
And so it affects the growth potential of
the firm, and it affects investors.
So just, investors are people too,
and they can be very much affected without
even realizing it by the brand name.
about using the value of the brand name to
infer make inferences
about the merits and strengths of the firm
as an investment opportunity.
So the brand name matters a lot in lots of
different ways.
So, what are the different types of brand
names?
There's lots of examples, and I'll just go
through this kind of quickly.
We can look at
this chart here.
You know, there's a descriptive brand
name, where
it just basically describes the product or
service.
Lean Cuisine is like that.
It's about non-fattening food.
You know exactly what the product is by
the brand name.
There can be brand names that are
metaphors,
that represent some kind of symbolism like
Nissan's Infinity.
A lot of the legacy brand names are based
on people's names.
So Ford or Ralph Lauren, those are real
people.
And the brand name
was chosen for, because it's based on a
particular person.
Sometimes there's brand names where the
word means something, but
it's not really clear how it applies to
the product.
Apple's a great example of, of that kind
of.
Or Camel, what are those, those are brand
names.
You know what the words mean and now,
certainly, they're
very famous brand names, so you understand
what they are.
But they don't really have any direct
connection with the product.
Then there can be brand names that are
altered.
They kind of sound like they're a real
word, but actually they're not, like
Lucent or Spotify.
You kind of have a sense what those brands
mean, and
you think you know what those words are,
but they're not real.
Or you can have a new word that's created
by blending together two other words.
Facebook is a great example of that that,
that's not a
real word, but you know what it is, a book
of faces.
And then, of course, there can be invented
words that
are not at all real and you have no idea
what
it means, and you can't even guess, like
something like Exxon.
Let me give you just three examples of
modern brand names that follow all
of these things, and you can see, these
brand names were extremely strong choices.
and they worked very very well, and they
were all very different.
So I'll start with Richard Branson's
Virgin.
He explains that the origin of that brand
name was when he was 15, he was sitting in
a room with other 15 year olds, and they
were trying
to think of the name, of a name for a
record company.
And a couple of the girls said, well,
we're all virgins here.
And somehow or another, that name just
seemed
to spark interest, and they said, well, if
we started a record company, we'd be
virgins
in that business, so let's use that name.
And apparently that's how that name was
chosen.
He mentioned that, at the time, it was
considered a pretty
risky brand name and it was hard to
register for a while.
But now, it's become an extraordinarily
strong brand name.
And, it, there, it's a funness to it that
actually
works really well with a lot of his
products and markets.
Priceline's a different type of brand
name.
That's a brand name that's quite
descriptive.
you know, if you know what that business
is,
you know it's absolutely about
establishing a line of prices.
It's quite clear what it means and it has
been very
useful in that way, in, in a different way
than Virgin.
And finally Google, which you know has now
become a verb, people
Google things, with, it's interesting that
brand name was chosen by mistake.
they meant it to be the word Googol, which
is not spelled the
way the brand is spelled, and that, that's
a very, very large number.
It's 1 with 100 zeros after.
So this was a mistake, they meant to spell
it right and they didn't.
Google's a very, very interesting brand
name from a marketing point
of view because one of the things that we
argue is extremely
important in brand names is consistency.
And Google has met, because it is so well
known, and
people identify it in just little pieces
of the brand name.
They identify the colors, they identify
the
typeface, that Google plays around, as
I've showed
you on this screen, where they'll show
you its trademark differently everytime
you see it.
Whenever you go to the browser, you'll see
a different version of the brand name.
That's a sign of an extraordinarily strong
brand name that has very, very high brand
awareness, that you can
see it even when it's not exactly the same
every single time.
But these are all fairly new brand names
that have been very, very successful.
When you look at new startups now, a lot
of the trend in
the new startups, and there was a recent
Wall Street Journal article about this.
the new startups are, are making up brand
names,
and so a lot of the new businesses come
up with brand names that are, just these
invented
words like Mibblio or Kaggle or Shodogg or
Zaarly.
You don't even know how to pronounce some
of these words.
Why is that happening?
Part of the, part of the reason is, in
today's world, when you
have a, a brand new business, you need a,
a website right away.
And most of the recognizable URLs have
already been taken and so one of
the ways to get a URL that's
uniquely identified with your business, is
to invent
a new word.
Then you're going to have to use the other
elements of the brand
mix to try to give some kind of identity
to this brand name.
Let me talk about an interesting hap,
thing that happened with brand names
somewhat recently.
The Gap brand name, a few years ago now,
I'm not sure exactly when.
But Gap wasn't doing very well with their
same store sales, revenues
were down, they really needed to do
something to turn the business around.
And one of the things they were trying to
do
to modernize it was to change the
trademark, or change the brand logo.
So the original brand logo as shown on the
screen is a blue square with the word Gap
in
white on that blue square and you can see
the new logo that they put out, is very
different.
The blue square has shrunk, the typeface
has changed it's now on a white
background.
And they put that
brand name out in, into their social media
market, and
instantly got very, very negative reaction
to that brand name.
The consumers hated it.
Within, that brand name was out there,
just tentatively, as a test, for one week.
The reaction was so negative that the
company pulled
it back and that was the end of that.
So it ended up actually being a, a pretty,
it was,
you know, they got a lot of publicity at
the time.
But it was a pretty
inexpensive way.
A lot of times, if you try to change your,
your
brand image, it's extremely expensive to
change it, especially for a retailer.
There's signage, there's bags, you know,
the, the packaging.
And all sorts of things that would be
very, very expensive.
So actually, that this got such a negative
reaction, that they
found out so quickly, it was, was a
benefit for the company.
But because this was somewhat of a famous
incident some market research was done,
and some
fMRI studies, and neurostudies were done
to figure
out what was so bad about that image.
Why did people not like it.
And there's a couple things that they
identified that
when I show you, you can see make sense.
One of them is, if you have visual and
verbal
things in conflict with each other, people
read the visual first.
And so where that blue box is, behind the
P, it, you're,
it actually kind of blocks out the P, and
you see a hole in the
P, and the P is not as strong because
you're attracted first to the vision.
So that weakened the whole idea of the
brand there.
because the P was kind of weakened because
of the visual block on it.
The other thing that, that's different
between the
two logos is that instead of being all
caps, which is in the original one, now
this is an initial cap and then smaller
letters.
And what that ended up doing was making
people think
of it as a word, rather then a brand name.
And if you think about it, the word gap,
that means
a hole, that's, you know, you have, that's
not so positive.
So when we're looking at these things in
hindsight, you
can kind of see why that wasn't a good
choice.
And people just didn't have a very strong
emotional reaction to it, also.
There were negative emotions to it that
were kind of more on
a visceral level, and what I'm explaining
here is, you know, more thoughtful.
and the last thing I want to mention in
thinking about brand names,
is a lot of people now, you've got to
think about global business.
And a lot of the business, the future
business is in China.
And that's tricky to think about how your
brand names might translate into Chinese.
And there's a number of issues there.
A number of different ways to do it.
One way is to keep your brand name in the
English let
or, the French letters, or the English
letters, or the non-Chinese letters.
some of the
luxury brands do that.
So, Chanel, or LV, you know, Louis
Vuitton, will do those kinds of things.
They keep them in their native language.
But other brands try to change their brand
name into Chinese.
And this is tricky because you can do it,
Coca-Cola, for example.
what does Coca-Cola mean?
How do you translate that?
And if you just go and look for
the Chinese characters that kind of sound
like Coca-Cola,
well, the characters themselves may mean
something.
So when Coca-Cola first did that and tried
to pick Chinese
characters that sounded like Coca-Cola, it
had a very bad brand meaning.
And they had to take that one off the
market.
The one they currently had, have means
tasty fun, so it kind of sounds
like Coca-Cola, and it means something
that at least makes sense with a drink.
Reebok did the same kind of thing, the
Chinese characters
that they chose kind of sound like Reebok
and it means, quick steps, which again
makes sense.
Colgate did something different.
Colgate picked Chinese characters that
they thought was
consistent with their brand image, which
meant superior cleanliness.
And then the Chinese characters, if you
said
them, didn't sound very much like the word
Colgate.
And Cadillac did it the opposite way.
They took Chinese characters that sounded
like
Cadillac, but they didn't mean anything in
Chinese.
So, when you're translating to a very,
very different language, and an important
language
like China, because of the size of the
market, there are some big issues.
And there are a lot of agencies now that
are developing
to help you choose a name that will make
sense in China.
