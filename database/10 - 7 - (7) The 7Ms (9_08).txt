So, hey again, everyone.
We're now in week three, module three.
We're talking about targeting our
messaging.
This is kind of the real fun stuff.
So those of you who might not have taken a
marketing course
before, you might have thought, yeah,
marketing's all that cool kind of
advertising.
Well this is the piece where we're getting
to that.
So let me go through and give a little bit
of an overview as I
typically do, of where we're going to go
with
this last piece of material in module
three.
First of all I'm just going to show you
some trends and some data.
How much are we all engaging with various
different kind of media?
Not just TV, but radio, our phones, the
internet, an so on.
I'm then going to give you an example of a
classic campaign
of a product that I grew up with way down
in New Zealand.
The product is milk, it's good for you.
And then I'm going to go into the example
of, I think it's a final acronym.
So we've had the 5 Cs, we have had
the 4 Ps, we had STPs, Segmentation Target
and Positioning.
Now we're going to do the 7 Ms, so, there
will be
a bit of suspense as all the Ms get read,
rolled out.
You can imagine what they might be, but
I'm
going to go through those, the 7 Ms of
Marketing
Communication, and then we are going to
look at
some different kinds of appeals, rational
appeals versus emotional appeals.
And then finally, I'm going to give you
some updates in terms of how social
media marketing is being done and what's
sort
of working and not working in that
environment.
So first of all the trends
we can go through fairly quickly.
You might want to dig into these a little
more and
to, to discuss them, and also, look for
some of them online.
I think it's very, very interesting and
quite instructive.
So, the first one here, again, these are
US data, but I would
imagine, they will be somewhat common
around other parts of the world, too.
So, first of all.
We're all just spending a heck of a lot of
time,
engaged with media, whether it's digital
media, TV, radio, and print.
One of the interesting things to me in
this particular graph is that TV has
remained pretty flat from 2010 projected
through 2013.
People still seem to like watching TV
although
they may be doing it in different forms
now.
If you look at the spending.
Spending in all media is up fairly
considerably,
again with TV sort of leading the way.
Then, the final chart I want to show you
is just the expected,
increase in marketing that is done on the
internet, so, search engine optimization,
display advertising, mobile marketing, and
so on.
And again, when we get to the end of this
discussion, I'm going to give you some of
the latest research.
On those different types of media that we
could be engaging in those different types
of technologies.
So, just to whet our appetites a little
bit for what's coming next, I'm going to
show you a classic campaign from the
United
States way, way back when, back in 1992.
So, the product, as I mentioned earlier,
is milk.
So this was the situation that was faced
by the California milk processing board
hopefully your companies
out there don't look like this but you can
see a fairly precipitous decline from 1987
to 1992.
People were just drinking a lot less milk,
maybe they
were drinking less coffee maybe they
thought the milk wasn't
so good for them, whatever the reasons
were, clearly consumption
of milk was going down and the California
Milk Processing Board
wanted to try and address this problem.
So, like all good marketers, they did some
surveys, and they found
that basically, people thought that milk
was healthy, most people thought that
milk tasted pretty good, and so the goal
was to increase the
consumption of milk by having people store
more milk in the home.
So this is a very, very interesting
phenomenon.
Maybe you've experienced it in your own
household.
When you have more product on hand,
you tend to use more of it.
So if you had a 12-pack of Pepsi in the
fridge, you're going to drink
a lot more Pepsi than if you only had a
six-pack, you'll start rationing it.
And if you're interested in this kind of
idea, particularly as it relates to
food, go and take a look at Brian Wansink
and his book called Mindless Eating.
He goes into this in a lot of detail.
Very interesting book.
So, here's a commercial.
I'll just encourage you to watch this on
your own time.
It's a commercial that was put together by
the Milk Processing Board
to kind of illustrate the point that it
would be very, very important for
you not to run out of milk and to have
milk in your home.
I won't spoil the punchline for you, but
the commercial starts with a
very obnoxious, obnoxious guy, probably in
some large US city, perhaps New York
City, and he's yelling at somebody on the
phone and firing him, and
just after he does that he gets run over
by a Mack truck.
A good ending, you might think.
But the story continues from there and
I'll let
you watch that and see what happens.
So, as a result of this campaign, it was
very, very effective for the California
Milk Processing Board.
And you can see some of the metrics here
and also
you can see the 7 Ms, so, first M is the
market.
Who was the target audience?
Well, the target audience was people who
currently drink milk.
The goal of the milk marketing board was
not
to try and get non milk drinkers to drink
milk.
That might be a more difficult challenge.
Perhaps there are people who don't like
milk for health reasons.
So, let's focus on current users.
Secondly, the message content.
The message content was to encourage
people to make sure
they have enough milk on hand so they
don't run out.
The mission, was to try and increase the
consumption of milk.
If you got more in the house, maybe you'll
drink one more glass per week.
The message design, or the creative
solution, was around the idea of
deprivation.
Oh my goodness, what's going to happen to
my life
if I run out of milk.
That's just going to be a terrible
catastrophe.
The media strategy was to use TV and
print,
of course we're back in 1992 at this
point.
The amount of money that was spent, I
don't have a good
indication of that, but clearly money was
spent to deliver this campaign.
And then, this is a very, very important
one.
Why is this important?
Well, there's a famous Philadelphian
called John Wanamaker.
Who in 1928 made a
quote, expressed a quote that probably
many of you have heard.
And he said, you know what, I know
half the money I spend on advertising is
wasted.
So that's a bit of a depressing thought.
If you're spending $10 million on
advertising in stores, 5 million's wasted.
So that's depressing enough, but then he
continues on.
And he says, and I don't know which half.
And this is really the perennial problem
with spending money
on marketing is that sometimes you don't
know whether it's effective.
And even if it is effective, you're not
sure exactly why.
That's why measurement is so critical.
And that's why I said, at the beginning of
our time together,
we should be thinking about marketing
expenditure on advertising and other
things.
Not as a strict expense that's purely
negative, but
really more like an asset that's going to
give us
some return in terms of more customer
affinity, more
loyal behavior, less price sensitivity,
more consumption and so on.
So they measured
two things in particular.
And firstly was to do with the execution
of the campaign itself, that's important.
So how many people could actually remember
the campaign, within three months of
it being shown, and there was a pretty
good number there, 60% of people.
Could actually remember having seen these
series of ads about milk.
You might want to go and look at some of
the other ones.
In addition to the one that I put in the
slides, there were some other very
humorous an very effective campaigns.
An then secondly, you don't want to just
measure
the effectiveness of the campaign, but,
you want to measure
the effectiveness of what the campaign is
designed to do.
In this crase, case, to increase sales.
And it was actually fairly effective, they
generated almost a 3% increase in sales
in milk over the period of the campaign,
which translates to about $30 million.
Great, so now we have that classic
campaign out of the way,
perhaps you have your own favorite
advertising campaign that you've been
exposed to.
What I'd like you
to do, if you do have a favorite campaign,
is to
reflect on that campaign now through the
lens of the 7 M's.
What do you think it was that the
advertiser was trying to do?
Do you think the advertisement was
effective?
How would you have measured that
effectiveness
if you were the one running the campaign.
So again here are our 7Ms, the markets.
Who should I talk to?
What's the target segment?
The message content, What am I going to
say?
How am I going to position it?
The mission.
What are we trying to accomplish here?
Thinking, feeling, action type objectives,
I'll talk about those in a moment.
The message design, that's really the
creative piece.
Are we going to try an be, very emotional
in the way we do this?
Are we going to try an be very rational in
the way that we do this?
The media strategy, is this going to be a
mobile advertising campaign, a TV
campaign, a billboard campaign?
All of the various tools available to us
to do this.
How much money are we going to spend, and
in
particular, what return on investment can
we expect to get?
And then finally the measurement.
This is absolutely critical.
You want to measure both the effectiveness
of the campaign itself.
Do people like it, remember it, understand
it?
And also what was the outcome?
Did I sell more?
Do people like me more as a result?
Did people change their opinion about what
it is that I'm doing?
Okay, so we've mentioned this a little bit
earlier on.
So some of this is going to be
somewhat of a recap and a repeat.
But I hope that it's useful for you, too.
I'm going to spend most of the time really
on the mission and also on the message.
So, that's what we're going to be talking
about because it
doesn't really make sense to give too many
other examples beyond
milk, with the other 5 Ms, because they're
going to be very,
very idiosyncratic to the type of product
that you're talking about.
