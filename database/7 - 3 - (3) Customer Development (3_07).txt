Now we're going to talk about customer
development and
before I ask you the same question I, I
first want to
be real clear what we mean by customer
development.
The general idea is we want to make our
customers
as valuable as possible, right, our
existing customers as
valuable as possible and so what are the
tactics associated
with customer development, what are the
kinds of things that companies
do in order to create and attract more
value from their
existing customers and that we usually
think about four different tactics.
You can think about yourself, as a manager
or as a customer, how you increase value.
Let's just review them real quickly, and
then
we'll go on and talk about managing
customer development.
So number one, is cross-selling, the idea
of getting customers to
buy more than just the particular product
that they're interested in.
So here in the US, millions of times a
day,
we hear people asking, do you want fries
with that?
That's an example of cross selling.
Getting people to buy other products.
They can either be from the same product
category like at an amazon.com
recommending other books
to you, or other product categories.
Cross selling.
Next to cross-selling would be up-selling.
And of course the classic fast food
example
there would be, do you want to super size
it?
So, try to get people to buy a higher
margin version of the same item.
Up-selling.
Again, very common not just in fast food
but
in, in financial services and, and many,
many industries.
You want to get people,
once they're going to buy something, let's
get them to buy a good something.
Those are the big two.
The third one would be frequency.
Let's just try to get people to buy our
stuff more often.
Very often that's why companies use
loyalty programs.
So let's give people just a little bit of
motivation.
Not just to buy this product, but to buy
it on a more frequent basis.
So, again a very common source of customer
development there.
And the fourth one, which companies don't
like to talk about, what they like
to do or at least they wished they could
do would be through margins.
Maybe not just up-selling people but maybe
we can get
people to pay more money for the same
product or service.
A lot of companies are very hesitant to do
that, they don't want to
mess around, charging different prices for
the
same product or service to different
people.
But as we discussed
way back earlier when, we were laying out
the case for
customer centricity, sometimes it makes a
lot of sense to do so.
So whether it's cross-selling, upselling,
frequency, or margin and
I'm not going to get into the, the, the
nitty gritty
details of, of exactly how we do those
things but
I just want to understand customer
development as a whole.
How we measure it, and where it fits in
with acquisition and retention.
