So, in addition to figuring out what
activities has, have
to be done and who is going to do them.
We need to make some other important
decisions about the design of our
distribution channel.
And one framework that's often helpful for
doing this
first is to think about the intensity of
distribution.
What do I mean by that?
Intensity I mean is, how many outlets or
how many channels
of distribution do we have serving us in a
particular market.
So, if we have an exclusive
distribution channel, that means in a
particular
market, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Tokyo,
wherever it is.
We just have one individual or one
distributor
or one entity who's bringing our product
to market.
Therefore on the other hand, we have
intensive distribution.
That means there are many, many providers
of
the product or service in a given market.
Obviously, if there are many of them,
this may be creating some competition
between them.
So what are some rules of thumb that we
need
to think about in determining whether or
not we want to go with.
Intensive distribution versus exclusive
distribution or
the mid point which is selective
distribution.
So, intensive distribution might be a good
thing.
When we don't really need any selling
support.
If it's a product like Coca-Cola we might
want it in every store, every vending
machine.
Every place possible just so it's made
available in order to minimize.
The consumers cost of accessing or
obtaining a product.
On the other hand, exclusive distribution
might be really, really important if
we want to try to find the strongest
provider and somehow reward them.
This is often used in the automobile
market.
If I'm selling expensive cars, like
Ferrari, I don't
want somebody right next door doing the
same thing.
I might want rights to have an exclusive
territory.
So that's the reason for having
exclusive distribution is to protect the
re-seller and
give them a chance to make a better
margin.
In the middle a selective distribution
where neither
of those other two extremes really seem to
fit.
The customers need to get access to
the product, but there is also some
consultative.
Selling that's required in order to
encourage
the end consumer to buy the product.
So now I'd like to reintroduce something
that
we've talked about earlier, and something
that we're familiar
with from our discussion of.
How to generate those lead users, and
expand the market beyond
the early customers, all the way to the
larger target base.
Here I'm showing the product life cycle.
As you may remember, it goes through four
phases.
Phase one is the introduction phase.
Then there's a growth phase, a maturity
phase.
And finally what most products and
services at
some point or brands at least enter into
a decline phase.
So let me give you an example of a very,
very simple product or service a piece of
home equipment.
For an entertainment system for showing
movies
and things in your home, your own home.
When the product's first introduced, let's
imagine it's initially introduced
in a very kind of, selective way with home
video specialists.
As the product gets into a growth phase
and we want it to be more widely
available.
Then maybe it goes into a larger
distributor.
Like a BestBuy or something like that if
we're talking about the United States.
Finally as the product gets into maturity,
we
might expand to other channels, such as
warmer.
And then finally, as it goes into the
decline.
The product may end up being sold on eBay
or other kinds of second hand markets.
So what you can see, as the product goes
through the life cycle.
The amount of information that's required
to sell it goes
down, because people are familiar with the
product or service.
But the intensity of the distribution
tends to go
up, we want the product to available
almost everywhere.
And because of that, the logistical needs
also kind of increase.
So, again, hopefully what you're seeing
from this is, when we're accessing
customers.
The access to customers is also related to
how the product is going through
it's own life cycle from introduction, to
growth, to maturity, and then to decline.
So let's continue with this idea
of the hybrid grid namely that their are
certain
entities, doing certain activities and
sort of an optimal way.
So, what are the implications of this view
or using a tool like the
hybrid grid to understand your own custom
axis plan your own channel of
distribution.
So, the first thing to keep in mind, is
that the kind
of activities that get done really depend
on the complexity of your product.
If you have a very, very complex product,
like that bovine
growth hormone I mentioned in the example.
There may be many, many things that need
to be done from education,
to awareness, to retrieval of the products
or after sales service and so on.
And so that's the first thing how complex
is my
product or service that will determine the
list of activities.
The second thing to keep in mind is
activities once
you've decided what needs to be done,
cannot be eliminated.
Once you've figured out the columns, they
are what
they are.
You cannot change those.
You can't suddenly decide not to provide
after sales
service typically or suddenly decide not
to generate new leads.
What you can do however, is you can change
who is performing what activity.
And that often leads to some very, very
interesting innovations.
So let me give you three examples.
So you could think about the notion of a
forward shift in function.
And that would
be IKEA for example, who used to in the
early days
do their own delivery and installation
decide at a certain point.
You know what?
We can't really do that, we're going to
let some third party do it.
So that sort of farming off an activity to
another entity, it was able to do it
better.
You might also think about a backwards
integration
as well this would be the case of Apple.
Taking over some of the function of
selling
the goods and services themselves in their
own stores,
as opposed to having independent retailers
do it for them.
And then thirdly we can think of a
sideways shift.
This would be Amazon using a parallel
company like FedEx
or UPS, to do the delivery of its goods
and services.
Rather than doing it themselves.
So this is a very, very important
implication.
You cannot eliminate activities, but you
can change or eliminate certain players.
And often, that's a vital source of
innovation like the Michael Dell
innovation for example.
Diapers.com, many, many innovative
businesses don't eliminate activities, but
what they do, do is they change who's
doing them.
The important thing of course to keep in
mind is that anyone who is performing an
activity
needs to be compensated, usually in the
form
of some kind of channel margin for doing
that.
Otherwise, they're going to stop that.
And this is sort of a nice segue-way for
us now into thinking about
the next thing, on your list.
After the structure of the channel, and
the design of
the channel, which is, how does one keep a
channel, coordinated.
So now let's get to our third piece on
the discussion of access to customers and
channels of distribution.
This is kind of a fun one.
This is the idea of, coordinating a
channel.
And when a channel often has conflict this
can be a kind of a tricky thing to do.
So let me just illustrate again by way of
a chart.
What can go on in a
distribution channel?
So, you may have a manufacturer on one
side saying
hey, why aren't you taking my entire range
of products.
And the distributor or the retailer says
well, hey I
don't want all the dogs, I just want the
best products.
I only want the 3 series BMW, I don't want
the 1 series, but the manufacturer wants.
All of them to be taken.
The manufacturer might say, we'd like some
more information about who's
coming into your store, your channel and
buying our product and service.
And the retailer might say, well we don't
keep any of that
information, and even if we did, we're not
going to give it to you.
The manufacturers and retailers might also
argue
over margins, so the manufacturer might
say.
Gee your taking too much margin and the
retailer
says well your wholesale prices to me are
too high.
So what we have here typically in a
channel
of distribution at independent businesses
that sometimes might be opposing.
And we want to try and figure out, what
are some solutions
to all of this conflicts.
Well let's go through some of that.
The first thing is that having some level
of conflict is good.
It keeps everybody on their toes.
You don't necessarily want all of the
channel, sorry, all
of the conflict in the channel to be
completely eliminated.
You want some there just to sort of
keep things fresh and to keep things
interesting.
So let's look at the diagram that explains
the two
main different types of conflict that
occur at a distribution channel.
And how we
can actually resolve these?
So in the blue there we have a
manufacturer, who's
distributing a product to three different
retailers A, B, and C.
And it could be the case that the
manufacturer, has
a conflictual situation with one or all of
the retailers.
And I'll show some examples of that in a
moment.
Secondly there's also the notion of
horizontal conflict.
Horizontal conflict, retailer B an C are
somehow, competing with each other, or
something unfortunate
is happening in that relationship.
So let's start with vertical conflict.
So here's a fairly famous case of vertical
conflict that I'd encourage
you again to, to look up a little bit on
the internet.
We have a manufacturer, Nike, who got into
a conflicting relationship, with its main
distributor, Foot Locker.
Foot Locker wasn't necessarily interested
in
selling and promoting every single SKU's,
Stock Keeping Unit of shoes and so on,
that Nike was selling.
Nike of course wanted
Foot Locker to make it a prominent brand
and to
give it a lot of support in the retail
stores.
So there was an inherent conflict between
these two entities that was a vertical
conflict.
So how could one resolve vertical conflict
in a relationship like this?
Well you could integrate.
So Nike could decide, you know what?
We're going to have our own stores.
And that's where we'll sell the products.
In fact, Nike does have some flagship
stores in various
places around the world.
Including the United States, so there's a
flagship
store in Chicago, San Francisco, and other
places.
That would be one solution to eliminate in
the conflict.
One of the player's just decides you know
,what I'm going to do the whole thing
myself.
The second thing that could be done to
eliminate conflict is we could change the
relationship.
And we could have franchised stores.
So a lot of companies in the gasoline
industry do this,
there are franchises for Exxon Mobil
gasoline.
Fast food there's franchises for McDonalds
and Dunkin' Doughnuts.
So that's also a way of minimizing
conflict
by bringing everybody under the same kind
of umbrella.
Those are both fairly legal or structural
ways of doing things.
You can also minimize conflict by being a
little bit
more subtle in the way that you do it by
monitoring.
What's going on with the downstream
player.
So, another way to
minimize conflict, would be to have
mystery
shoppers going to the various Foot Locker
stores.
And seeing what's going on there, and then
report back to
the other corporate entities and then
negotiate if something was amiss.
So those are various ways, both implicit
and explicit, that vertical conflict could
be removed.
Another way you could do it if you were
the manufacture
is you could say you know what, I'll
minimize vertical conflict by.
Only giving
the top performing retailers my hot
products and my best sellers.
I'll sort of use a carrot and stick
approach, to get rid
of some of the conflict of who's getting
what in the relationship.
So that's vertical conflict.
So now let's move on to horizontal
conflict.
Horizontal conflict is really fascinating,
and many ways
more subtle than the notion of vertical
conflict.
So by horizontal conflict, we mean
conflict between
players of the same level of the channel.
So a conflict between retailers A, B, and
C in my example.
So why does this horizontal conflict
occur?
Well, unless those retailers are literally
carbon copies of each other
in terms of the level of service and
prices that they provide.
There's the potential for something called
horizontal free-riding,
which is actually the behavior of you and
I.
So let me explain that.
So imagine that there are low-price,
low-ser, low-service retailers.
And high price, high service retailers.
And let's take a simple example of
consumer electronics.
And for argument sake let's imagine that
there's a
high price, high service retailer in my
local neighborhood.
Let's call that Chris's Hi-Fi store.
And also there's a, a lower
price, retailer in the same neighborhood,
let's call that Amy's Discount Store.
So, there's a high-priced
seller, high service, and a low-priced
seller, that's offering list service.
So what might I do as a consumer?
Well, I might go to Chris' store.
I might spend an hour engaging with
the salesperson, learning about exactly
the right
kind of color TV, sound system, and so on
to put into my home.
And then instead of buying it.
What I do is I walk across the street to
Amy's store and I get the lower price.
So what I've done is I've taken something
that's been provided by Chris not
compensated him for it.
And in fact got a lower price from Amy,
this is called horizontal free-riding.
And then its most extreme form, we see it
in terms of the phenomenon cheruming.
Where I go into a store, I engage with the
salesperson, I look at all the
variety, I touch and feel the sweater to
make sure its the one that I want.
And then I go to sweaters.com or
amazon.com and buy
it at a low price.
So how could we possibly get around that
sort of situation.
Well let's start with traditional
horizontal free riding
before we go into the phenomenon of
cheruing.
So what we could do is we could reduce the
number
of retailers per territory to separate
Chris' store from Amy store.
We could try and make those
stores more uniform through something like
franchising.
But in general
what we could do is we could create
more like selective or exclusive
distribution that would minimize.
The chance, of horizontal free-riding.
It's a little bit more difficult though
when we get to the internet.
So we'll look at some statistics on that,
in a moment.
